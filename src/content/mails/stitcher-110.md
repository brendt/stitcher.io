Hi ::subscriber.first_name::

You're not mistaken! It's still me, Brent. I've given my newsletter a slight refresher, especially to look better on mobile. Please let me know if you run into any styling issues on your device, though!

I've got big news today â€” very big news. I've been working (mostly in silence) on a **new book**, and today it's finally releasing! I've kept mostly quiet about it because I didn't know whether I'd be able to finish it, but here we are!

The book is called **Things I wish I knew when I started programming**. Ironically, it features almost zero code. Rather, it's about the many things I've learned along the way being a professional programmer, as well as the many, many mistakes I made along that way as well. It's what I wish someone would have told me years ago, and I hope it might inspire you.

When I drafted this book, I had around six chapters in mind, without a clear ending to it. Eventually, I ended up with fourteen, where the final chapters kind of "revealed" themselves to me while writing. At one point I realized that some of the insights I shared were still very actual to me, and I learned more than one thing from my own book ðŸ˜….

I hope you'll consider reading it, and if you do also share your feedback with me (good and bad).

A digital version is available via Apple Books, Kindle, Leanpub, and Google Play. My recommendation would be to get the paperback version though because there's some interactivity with the reader that's easiest to do with a physical book, but â€” up to you. You can find all info on the website: **[https://things-i-wish-i-knew.com/](https://things-i-wish-i-knew.com/)**.

Until next time!

Brent
