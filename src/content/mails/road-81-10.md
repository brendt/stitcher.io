Here we are, arrived at the very last mail (you'll be unsubscribed from this list automatically).

Before we end though, I'd like to mention a few more smaller features and changes that come with PHP 8.1, in no particular order:

- There's a new `array_is_list` function that checks whether an array only contains ordered, numerical keys
- Class constants can be made final
- There's a new `fsync` function that forces synchronisation of file changes to disk
- There's a new explicit octal notation: you can use `0o` and `0O` to prefix octal numbers
- Passing null to non-nullable arguments in internal functions have been deprecated
- And several more small deprecations, you can check out [my list](https://stitcher.io/blog/new-in-php-81) to have a full overview

Honestly, I'm very exited to start using PHP 8.1, it's a great release with tons of feature I've been wanting for a long time. What's your opinion? Make sure to hit the reply button on this email if you want to share your thoughts!


Now, before we go, I'd like to mention a few more things: you'll be automatically unsubscribed from this list after this email, so if you want to keep in touch, you can follow me in a few other places:

- [My main newsletter](https://stitcher.io/newsletter/subscribe), where I occasionally share updates about my blog, writing and other projects
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brendt_gd), where I tweet about whatever is on my mind
- And, of course, [my blog](https://stitcher.io/)

I'd also like to share my book with you: [Front Line PHP](https://front-line-php.com/). It's a practical book about modern-day PHP development, it covers topics like PHP 7 and 8, but also OOP, patterns and principles, testing etc. — you can read a few sample chapters on [the website](https://front-line-php.com/). I'm working on an update for PHP 8.1 (it'll be included with previous purchases), that's coming soon!


Finally, if you enjoyed this series and it was helpful to you, I would very much appreciate it if you [share it](https://road-to-php.com/) with your colleagues, friends or follower base, thanks!

With all of that being said, thanks for reading, and hope you'll enjoy PHP 8.1!

Until next time!

Brent
