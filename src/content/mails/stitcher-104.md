Hi ::subscriber.first_name::

It's almost time: PHP 8.4 releases tomorrow! I personally think this is one of the most impactful PHP releases in years, so yes, I'm excited! 

First up, I want to share my [what's new in PHP 8.4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mokBtjyT8fo) video: a 4-minute summary of the most impactful changes in the next release. I also need to mention my [what's new blog post](https://stitcher.io/blog/new-in-php-84), which I updated last week to include a lot more features and changes.

Next, I'm going to celebrate! üòÅ Tomorrow at 1PM CET, I'll do a livestream together with Roman, Nicolas, and you ‚Äî of course. I hope to see you there, because we're going have a great time together, not just talking about PHP 8.4, but also celebrating the awesomeness that is PHP. Here's the link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AL2oDt9q38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AL2oDt9q38)

Finally, I'd like to hear from you: what was your highlight of 2024 when it comes to PHP? It could be a personal achievement, something community-related you're excited about; maybe an open source package or something else. Let me know by pressing the reply button!

See you tomorrow üëã
