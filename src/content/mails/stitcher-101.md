Hi ::subscriber.first_name::

I've got lots of small news items I want to share with you today. First off: I'm going to **stream in two hours** (around 1PM CEST), we're going to look at a new TUI library in PHP. If you don't know what that's about, all the more reason to join! Here's the [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/live/UbWFoXG2QiA), and — not unimportant — I'm now also **streaming on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/brendt_gd)**, so you might want to follow me there as well.

Next, I've been working on a video series for JetBrainsTV about [getting started with PhpStorm](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ176FUIyIUbsiX48E_FPXFmaTFvgLTFO). My goal is to make short-and-to-the-point videos that make newcomers feel empowered by PhpStorm within minutes. I know PhpStorm can be intimidating when you boot it for the first time, and I want turn that feeling of intimidation into empowerment. Feel free to share your feedback with me!

Then there's some news about **Tempest**: we are **ready to tag the first alpha release**! It's a pretty big step, and I think I'll do it next week so that I have some time to write a blog post about it. It's super nice knowing that two years of working on this project is finally coming to something I can share with the world. I'm excited about it, and I'll keep you posted!

Finally, speaking of Tempest, one of the latest features is a **static site generator**, it's pretty cool and I wrote a blog post about it last week explaining [how it works under the hood](https://stitcher.io/blog/a-simple-approach-to-static-generation).

That's all I have for today, I hope to see you in a hour or two on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/live/UbWFoXG2QiA) or [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/brendt_gd)!

Until then

Brent
