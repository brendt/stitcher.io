Hi ::subscriber.first_name::

I'm not big on celebrating things, so let me just say I'm proud of having written my hundredth newsletter, and I'm humbled with you reading it! So, thanks for being here, it means a lot :)

I wanna share a couple of things with you today. First is a blog post that I wrote: [Extend or Implement](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/2bd16682-4d0b-4da0-8b44-a480f032e2a7). It talks about my vision on when to use inheritance, and when to rely on interfaces instead. I'm not entirely sure how to phrase what I mean, but it's a start. I would really like to hear your thoughts about it!

Related to my deep-dive into inheritance, I was inspired to write to the internals mailing list this morning. I want to propose â€” for a variety of reasons â€” that traits can implement interfaces directly. You can read [my mail to internals](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/1ef5caa1-f9a8-467f-9fee-49e1b2a81428), and feel free to share your thoughts about it as well!

Next, generics ðŸ˜³ there was this super interesting blog post by the Foundation about [the state of generics](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/1b0838b1-00b4-4e6b-9f76-0643035e2781). I really recommend reading through it, or you could watch [my reaction video](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/24f83cf6-88de-4524-9082-ba431c5ca403) if you'd also like to hear my thoughts about it. I'm still convinced runtime-ignored generics are the way to go, and the only thing missing from PHP these days is cleaner syntax. It's great that the Foundation is looking into all possibilities, and I'm looking forward to reading updates about it in the future!

In closing, I did publish some more chapters of [my work-in-progress sci-fi novel](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/74a878f5-297b-47f3-b7f9-071ecb6d2646). I'm actually gonna work with an editor to get my writing style to the next level, and I might even self-publish it one day. I realise you're not here to read me ramble about it, but it's a really fun project and I like to mention it now and then. 

Anyway, that's all for today, thanks for being here!
