Hi ::subscriber.first_name::

You're receiving this email because you signed up for updates about my work in progress book: [**PHP: Patterns and Principles**](https://patterns-principles.com/). That book is still being worked on, and as it often goes in life, will take more time than expected.

In the meantime, though, I want to share an update about another book I've been working on: [**Things I wish I knew when I started programming**](https://things-i-wish-i-knew.com/) got published today. It's a book about the many things I've learned along the way being a professional programmer, and about the many mistakes I made along that way as well.

Because you're still waiting for the patterns and principles book, I want to give you a discount code with 25% off on the minimum price for this one: [**https://leanpub.com/things-i-wish-i-knew/c/php-pp**](https://leanpub.com/things-i-wish-i-knew/c/php-pp). I hope you'll enjoy it!

Kind regards

Brent
