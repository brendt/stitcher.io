Here you find an overview of all the books I've written before.

## Things I wish I knew when I started programming

This is my newest book aimed at programmers of any skill level. This book isn't about patterns, principles, or best practices; there's actually barely any code in it. It's about the many things I've learned along the way being a professional programmer, and about the many, many mistakes I made along that way as well.  It's what I wish someone would have told me years ago, and I hope it might inspire you.
