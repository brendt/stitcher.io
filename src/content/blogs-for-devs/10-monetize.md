While making money with my blog isn't my primary goal, it's still nice to have a little extra income from a hobby project.

## Ads

Ads are probably the worst way to monetise your blog. While they are easy to set up, they also:

- are blocked by many clients,
- often are irrelevant to your audience,
- pay very little compared to other monetisation options.

If you're starting out though, ads are pretty much the only option you've got. I only started playing around with ads after a year or so, and only managed to make 5 - 10 USD a month. It's a nice way of covering hosting and DNS costs, but that's about it.

Ever since my blog started to grow in popularity though, ads became a little more profitable. With 2-3k users per day, I now earn between 50 and 80 USD per month using ads. That means I can buy a pizza now and then, maybe sometimes a game for my wife and I to play on the Nintendo Switch. 

To make something clear: 50 USD a month extra for doing your hobby is great, I'm very thankful for that. I just want to be clear about how difficult it is if your goal is to make blogging into your full-time job. Since I don't want to do that, I'm perfectly fine with just a little extra.

There _is_ one sidenote to be made though: the CPM rate of ads (cost per mille, the amount your earn per 1000 impressions) will highly depend on the niche you're in. The reality is that blogging about programming and web development (like I do) has a very low CPM rate. So while you'd make lots more money in other niches like travel or food, those are often much more competitive as well, meaning you'd need to spend a lot more time and effort in growing your blog.

So while ads are a nice way of earning a little extra with your blog, there are better approaches, especially when you're in the tech niche.

## Sponsors

- Direct sponsors are a better way of monetisation
- It's only viable if you have a decent amount of visitors, which is why SEO visitors are nice: no effort for a steady flow of traffic
- Price to ask per week will depend on how much visitors you have per week, and also look at how much they'd make on average per customer. 
- Sponsor messages can't be ad blocked
- Sponsors can cancel
- Patreon

## Selling your own products

- Own control
- The most work
- Possibly the most profitable
- Your blog isn't just about writing anymore
