A little over a year ago, I was sitting in the doctor's office when she told me I had to stop and take a break. I was close to burning out, and now was the time to make changes. One thing that played a role in getting to that point was the feeling of juggling too many things at once. Something I think many people can relate to.

The idea of so many things "going on" was a major stress factor, and I had to learn how to better deal with that. So I took a piece of paper and wrote down everything that kept me busy: projects at work, hobby projects, some community projects I was working on in my free time, family, etc. It was a long list of "things on my mind". Here's an example, although the real list was twice or three times as long:

Writing this down already gave me some rest, but I felt like I needed more. Realistically, there was too much on this list, and I knew I had to make some choices. I had to learn to focus on a handful of things because this was simply too much.

Looking at my list, I wondered: "how do I choose?" Sure, "stop working" would have a huge impact on getting more time, but it would also have rather disastrous financial consequences. I had to find a way to sort this list based on multiple criteria. 

So my next step was to write down these criteria or "metrics" that I found important enough to take into the equation. "Financial impact" was obvious, but I also wanted to know the impact of each project on my happiness and the amount of time it consumed. So a sketched a quick table:

Now it was a matter of rating every project for every impact category. I decided on a scale from 1 to 5: `--` meant the biggest or most negative impact; `-` a little less; `Â±` was neutral, and then there was `+`, and `++` as well for positive impact. I didn't have any strict rules on what each value meant, I figured I'd just start and see where I'd end up.

There was one issue, though: halfway through my ratings, I realized I wasn't completely honest. I was rating these projects based on what I _wanted_ them to be, rather than what they actually were. So I took a new paper and started again, this time forcing myself to be truly honest. That wasn't easy to do, but eventually I ended up with this:

Now we were getting somewhere. For the first time in a long while, I felt like I got a proper overview of what was "going on", _and_ I now had a way to prioritize it.

I took one more step: I gave each item an "average", or "overall" score. This wasn't an exact science because for some things â€” like my job â€” the financial impact weighed more than the impact it had on time. I first tried to sum everything up (-2, -1, 0, 1, and 2), but that sometimes gave an average that didn't feel right. So I did a second pass and adjusted the overall result wherever it felt off. I didn't have a formula for it, I just followed my gut:

With all data collected, I realized I didn't have any "personal projects" that had an overall positive impact. That's because all of them were still kind of connected to "work"; or at least to my role as a "known person in the PHP community" (I don't want to say "influencer" ðŸ˜…)

This was a crucial realization: I had nothing on this list that I could do just to recharge. I had to add some things for me. So I decided to start singing classes and music school. It was something I had been wanting to do for years but never made time for. Something just for me. I also took up writing and wrote [a sci-fi novel](http://timeline-taxi.com/), just because I wanted to.

Next, I scratched one or two items from this list. Even though I had fond memories of many projects, I knew it was better to let go of some things so that I could better focus my energy and feel less overwhelmed. Sometimes it's ok to let go.

In the end, this list was such a small thing to do, it literally took ten minutes, but it had such a big impact. I now make a new list every couple of months. I note the date on each paper and keep them with me. It's interesting to see the list evolve over time: some projects come, others go. Some project's impact ratings change over time â€” for better or for worse â€” and it signifies that I might need to make changes.

It was such a small thing, but it helped so much. And I think it can help a lot of other people as well, which is why I wanted to write it down. I've started to call these "impact charts", but I'm sure I'm not the first one who came up with this idea. 

After that sci-fi novel, by the way, I wrote a new book called "[Things I wish I knew when I started programming](https://things-i-wish-i-knew.com/)", and impact charts are one of the items described in the book as well. You can always [check it out](https://things-i-wish-i-knew.com/) if you're interested, I'm confident there are many other valuable lessons you can learn from it.
