I turned 30 last week, and it made me realise I've been coding for more than half of my life now. I took a moment to reflect on my code these days, and realised that 20-year-old me would probably facepalm if he'd see my write code today.

First, I pretty much gave up on abstractions. Abstractions are becoming more and more of a rarity. I just find that 95% of problems don't need abstractions, they just need to be solved in place. I remember always reaching for abstractions whenever a problem could _possibly_ need it, and I always ended up with an overcomplicated mess.

Second, I find myself liking a functional mindset more and more. It's just simpler. This has been in the making [for years now](/blog/what-are-objects-anyway-rant-with-brent), and I just find myself much more comfortable splitting data and functionality, and keeping things flat.

Next, testing is still a struggle. I don't get it. I know testing makes my life easier. I know it's good in the long run. And still, I struggle with it. In part, I think it's because of the friction and overhead that comes with a testing framework: the setup, mocking, faking data, … It's really a shame that testing doesn't come more natural. I force myself to do it — and it always pays off — but still. I don't get it.

I'm using less fancy shorthands. I don't care about clever oneliners anymore. I'd prefer to write a verbose if/else statement than trying to cram the same functionality in one line of code. Less is less, not more.

Also, I can't live without static analysis anymore. I remember using Sublime for the first 2 or 3 years of my professional programming career, but I don't understand how I made that work.

Finally, I'm still using PHP. It's a language with quirks, but it's ok, it gets the job done. I used to always want to latest and greatest, but I'm totally fine with PHP these days. 

- A lot less abstractions
- More functional mindset, but still OO
- Testing is still a struggle
- A lot less fancy shorthands
- Typed and static analysis
- Still write PHP

The older I get, I want things to be simpler, straight to the point. I long for simplicity.
