If you think about it, most programming challenges can be boiled down to one or two things: text processing and data mapping.

Let's see: I'm currently improving [Tempest's ORM](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/), which means nothing more than "generating the right queries (text processing), and mapping the data unto objects". 

I while ago, I wrote a [code highlighter](https://github.com/tempestphp/highlight). It's basically the definition of text processing. I also built a [console framework](https://tempest.stitcher.io/console/01-getting-started), which is nothing more than processing an incoming command (which is text), and generating the appropriate output (which is text). Routing? Processing an HTTP request (text), map its data to a controller, and eventually return text again. Building a template engine? Text processing.

Especially with programming languages like PHP, within a web context; 99% of things we're doing is processing text and moving data from one point to another. I like that realization, because it means I can boil down what seem to be the hardest problems, into relatively simple pieces. I wanted to share that with you, maybe you have some additional thoughts? You can leave a comment to let me know!
