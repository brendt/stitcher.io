PHP 8.4 will be released on [November 21, 2024](https://wiki.php.net/todo/php84). It'll include property hooks, JIT improvements, as well as chaining methods on `{php}new` without additional parentheses — a big one!

### Property hooks <small>[RFC](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/property-hooks)</small>

One of the biggest changes in modern-PHP history: the ability to define property hooks, eliminating the need for a lot of boilerplate code.

```php
class BookViewModel
{
    public function __construct(
        private array $authors,
    ) {}

    public string $credits {
        get {
            return implode(', ', array_map(
                fn (Author $author) => $author->name, 
                $this->authors,
            ));
        }
    }
    
    public Author $mainAuthor {
        set (Author $mainAuthor) {
            $this->authors[] = $mainAuthor;
            $this->mainAuthor = $mainAuthor;
        }
        
        get => $this->mainAuthor;
    }
}
```

The goal of property hooks is to remove a lot of getters and setters, by allowing each property to define its own `{:hl-keyword:get:}` and `{:hl-keyword:set:}` hooks. Hooks are optional, and you don't have to add both of them on a specific property. For example, a property with only a `{:hl-keyword:get:}` hook is virtual property.

There is a lot to say about property hooks, and I plan to write a followup post on them soon, so make sure to [subscribe](*/mail) if you want to know when that one is done. One final thing I'd like to mention — probably what I'm most hyped about: property hooks can be defined in interfaces!

```php
interface HasAuthors
{
    public string $credits { get; }
    public Author $mainAuthor { get; set; }
}
```

### `{php}new` without parentheses <small>[RFC](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/new_without_parentheses)</small>

As if property hooks alone wasn't enough, PHP 8.4 has another feature that will save so much boilerplate code: you don't have to wrap `{php}new` invocations within parenthesis anymore to be able to chain methods on them. So instead of doing this:

```php
$name = (new ReflectionClass($objectOrClass))->getShortName();
```

You can now do this:

```php
$name = new ReflectionClass($objectOrClass)->getShortName();
```

I don't know about you, but I write a lot of code like this, and so I'm super happy that we're finally getting rid of those brackets. It doesn't only work for methods, by the way. You can also chain properties, static methods, constants — whatever you want. You can read all about this new feature in this [dedicated post](/blog/new-with-parentheses-php-84).

### JIT changes <small>[RFC](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/jit_config_defaults)</small>

PHP 8.4 changes the way the [JIT](/blog/php-jit) is enabled. Previously, you had to set `opcache.jit_buffer_size` to `0` in order to disable the JIT, but now you can disable it like so:

```ini
opcache.jit=disable
opcache.jit_buffer_size=64m
```

The only way users can be affected by this change is if they did specify a `opcache.jit_buffer_size` but no `opcache.jit`. In that case, you'll have to add `opcache.jit=tracing` to enable the JIT again.

Finally, there have also been some [improvements to the JIT](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/jit-ir) which makes it run faster in some cases, and use less memory.

### Implicit nullable types <small class="breaking">[deprecation](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate-implicitly-nullable-types)</small>

PHP had this weird behaviour where a typed variable with a default `{php}null` value would be made nullable automatically:

```php
function save(Book $book = null) {}

// Deprecated: Implicitly marking parameter $book as nullable is deprecated,
// the explicit nullable type must be used instead
```

This behaviour is now deprecated and will be removed in PHP 9. The solution is to make `{php}Book` explicitly nullable:

```php
function save(?Book $book = null) {}
```

---

### New DOM HTML5 support <small>[RFC](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/domdocument_html5_parser)</small>

PHP 8.4 adds a `{php}\Dom\HTMLDocument` class which is able to parse HTML5 code properly. The old `{php}\DOMDocument` class is still available for backwards compatibility.

```php
$doc = \Dom\HTMLDocument::createFromString($contents);
```

PHP 8.4 is still in the early development phase, so there's of course more to come. I'll update this post over time, so make sure to [subscribe](*/mail) if you want to be kept in the loop.
