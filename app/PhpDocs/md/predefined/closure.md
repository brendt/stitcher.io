 The Closure class
 Closure

 


  
   Introduction
   
    Class used to represent anonymous
    functions.
   

   
    Anonymous functions yield objects of this type.
    This class has methods that allow
    further control of the anonymous function after it has been created.
   

   
    Besides the methods listed here, this class also has an
    __invoke method. This is for consistency with other
    classes that implement calling
    magic, as this method is not used for calling the function.
