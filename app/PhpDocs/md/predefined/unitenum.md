 The UnitEnum interface
 UnitEnum

 


  
   Introduction
   
    The UnitEnum interface is automatically applied to all
    enumerations by the engine.  It may not be implemented by user-defined classes.
    Enumerations may not override its methods, as default implementations are provided
    by the engine.  It is available only for type checks.
