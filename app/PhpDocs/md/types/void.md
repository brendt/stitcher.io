 
## Void
 
 `void` is a return-only type declaration indicating the function does not return a value, but the function may still terminate. Therefore, it cannot be part of a [union type](language.types.type-system.composite.union)] declaration. Available as of PHP 7.1.0. 
 
<div class="note">
     
 Even if a function has a return type of void it will still return a value, this value is always null.
