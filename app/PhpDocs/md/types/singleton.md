 
## Singleton types
 
 Singleton types are those which allow only one value. PHP has support for two singleton types: <!-- start type -->
<!--
false
--> as of PHP 8.0.0 and <!-- start type -->
<!--
true
--> as of PHP 8.2.0. 
 
<div class="warning">
     
 Prior to PHP 8.2.0 the false type could only be used as part of a union type.

 It is not possible to define custom singleton types. Consider using an enumerations instead.
