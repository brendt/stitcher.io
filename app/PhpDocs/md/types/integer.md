 An int is a number of the set â„¤ = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}.

## Syntax
 
 Ints can be specified in decimal (base 10), hexadecimal (base 16), octal (base 8) or binary (base 2) notation. The negation operator can be used to denote a negative int. 
 
 To use octal notation, precede the number with a `0` (zero). As of PHP 8.1.0, octal notation can also be preceded with `0o` or `0O`. To use hexadecimal notation precede the number with `0x`. To use binary notation precede the number with `0b`. 
 
 As of PHP 7.4.0, integer literals may contain underscores (`_`) between digits, for better readability of literals. These underscores are removed by PHP's scanner. 
 
<div class="example">
     
## Integer literals
 

```php
<?php
$a = 1234; // decimal number
$a = 0123; // octal number (equivalent to 83 decimal)
$a = 0o123; // octal number (as of PHP 8.1.0)
$a = 0x1A; // hexadecimal number (equivalent to 26 decimal)
$a = 0b11111111; // binary number (equivalent to 255 decimal)
$a = 1_234_567; // decimal number (as of PHP 7.4.0)
?>
```
 
</div>
 
 Formally, the structure for `int` literals is as of PHP 8.1.0 (previously, the `0o` or `0O` octal prefixes were not allowed, and prior to PHP 7.4.0 the underscores were not allowed): 
 
 

```
decimal     : [1-9][0-9]*(_[0-9]+)*
            | 0

hexadecimal : 0[xX][0-9a-fA-F]+(_[0-9a-fA-F]+)*

octal       : 0[oO]?[0-7]+(_[0-7]+)*

binary      : 0[bB][01]+(_[01]+)*

integer     : decimal
            | hexadecimal
            | octal
            | binary
```
 
 
 The size of an `int` is platform-dependent, although a maximum value of about two billion is the usual value (that's 32 bits signed). 64-bit platforms usually have a maximum value of about 9E18. PHP does not support unsigned `int`s. `int` size can be determined using the constant `PHP_INT_SIZE`, maximum value using the constant `PHP_INT_MAX`, and minimum value using the constant `PHP_INT_MIN`. 
 
 
 
## Integer overflow
 
 If PHP encounters a number beyond the bounds of the `int` type, it will be interpreted as a `float` instead. Also, an operation which results in a number beyond the bounds of the `int` type will return a `float` instead. 
 
<div class="example">
     
## Integer overflow
 

```php
<?php
$large_number = 50000000000000000000;
var_dump($large_number);         // float(5.0E+19)

var_dump(PHP_INT_MAX + 1);       // 32-bit system: float(2147483648)
                                 // 64-bit system: float(9.2233720368548E+18)
?>
```
 
</div>
 
 
 
## Integer division
 
 There is no `int` division operator in PHP, to achieve this use the `intdiv` function. `1/2` yields the `float` `0.5`. The value can be cast to an `int` to round it towards zero, or the `round` function provides finer control over rounding. 
 
<div class="example">
     
## Divisions
 

```php
<?php
var_dump(25/7);         // float(3.5714285714286)
var_dump((int) (25/7)); // int(3)
var_dump(round(25/7));  // float(4)
?>
```
 
</div>
 
 
 
## Converting to integer
 
 To explicitly convert a value to int, use either the (int) or (integer) casts. However, in most cases the cast is not needed, since a value will be automatically converted if an operator, function or control structure requires an int argument. A value can also be converted to int with the intval function. 
 
 If a resource is converted to an int, then the result will be the unique resource number assigned to the resource by PHP at runtime.

    From floating point numbers
   

   
    When converting from float to int, the number
    will be rounded towards zero.
    As of PHP 8.1.0, a deprecation notice is emitted when implicitly converting a non-integral float to int which loses precision.
   

   
    Casting from Float
    

<?php

function foo($value): int {
  return $value;
}

var_dump(foo(8.1)); // "Deprecated: Implicit conversion from float 8.1 to int loses precision" as of PHP 8.1.0
var_dump(foo(8.1)); // 8 prior to PHP 8.1.0
var_dump(foo(8.0)); // 8 in both cases

var_dump((int) 8.1); // 8 in both cases
var_dump(intval(8.1)); // 8 in both cases
?>

    
   

   
    If the float is beyond the boundaries of int (usually
    +/- 2.15e+9 = 2^31 on 32-bit platforms and
    +/- 9.22e+18 = 2^63 on 64-bit platforms),
    the result is undefined, since the float doesn't
    have enough precision to give an exact int result.
    No warning, not even a notice will be issued when this happens!
   

   
    
     NaN, Inf and -Inf will always be zero when cast to int.
    
   

   
    
     Never cast an unknown fraction to int, as this can
     sometimes lead to unexpected results.
    

    
     

<?php
echo (int) ( (0.1+0.7) * 10 ); // echoes 7!
?>

     
    

    
     See also the warning about float
     precision.
