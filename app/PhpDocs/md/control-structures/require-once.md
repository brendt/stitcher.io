 The `require_once` expression is identical to <!-- start function -->
<!--
require
--> except PHP will check if the file has already been included, and if so, not include (require) it again. 
 
 See the <!-- start function -->
<!--
include_once
--> documentation for information about the `_once` behaviour, and how it differs from its non `_once` siblings.
