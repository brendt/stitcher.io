When asking on Twitter for writing advice, I was suggested to check out [Sarah Mischinger's](*https://twitter.com/codingwriter) blog:
[codingwriter.com](*https://codingwriter.com/).
This is a great blog to follow for the technical bloggers out there, myself included.

To me, blogging is more than just shouting my opinion in some corner of the web;
I hope people may learn, the same way I do, by reading other people's blogs.
Writing good content is essential, and I was happy to discover a blog focused on this exact topic.
