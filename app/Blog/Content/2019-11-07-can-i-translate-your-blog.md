Yes. Yes you can. I do ask you to keep a few rules in mind.

## Host on your own

Your translations should be hosted on your own blog. Maybe it's helpful for you to have access to the markdown source files, they can be found [here](*https://github.com/brendt/stitcher.io/tree/master/src/content/blog).

## Proper attribution

You're required to add a link to the original post at the start of your translation. Furthermore, please add a link tag in the `<head>` of your page to also point to the original post.

```html
<head>
    <!-- … -->

    <link 
        rel="<hljs text>alternate</hljs>" 
        hreflang="<hljs text>en</hljs>"
        href="<hljs text>https://stitcher.io/blog/can-i-translate-your-blog</hljs>" />
</head>
```

## Notify me about translations

I'd like to know about when you put a translation online. I plan on listing all translations on my blog somewhere at some point in the future, so it'd be handy if I could add yours.

You can notify me via [Twitter](*https://twitter.com/brendt_gd), [e-mail](mailto:brendt@stitcher.io) or by making a [GitHub issue](*https://github.com/brendt/stitcher.io)

## Translate, don't interpret

I expect translations to be as close as possible to the original. You can add your own thoughts, but only if properly addressed. For example you can add a final section with additions to the original post, as long as you make it clear that it's not part of the original.

One final remark: I appreciate it very much when people want to translate my content, so thank you very much!
