A couple of weeks ago, I shared a bit about [the financial side of running stitcher.io](/blog/sponsors). I explained how I would like stitcher.io to be break-even after a large sponsor deal had ended. 

Today I want to thank [Kinsta](https://kinsta.com/) in particular for stepping in and helping out! They've committed to a generous monthly sponsorship, which is getting me closer to achieving that break-even goal.

If you haven't heard of Kinsta before, they are a cloud platform targeted towards companies and dev teams to help them ship and manage their web projects. What I like about companies like Kinsta is that they are always on the lookout for helping out the community members like they did with my sponsor issue. They contacted me out of the blue saying they wanted to help, which I really appreciate!

So big thanks to Kinsta for helping me work on stitcher.io in my free time!
