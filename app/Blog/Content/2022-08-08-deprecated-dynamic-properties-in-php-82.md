As is common with minor releases, [PHP 8.2](/blog/new-in-php-82) adds some deprecations. Deprecations often are a source of frustration, though it's important to realise they are actually very helpful. I already wrote about [dealing with deprecations](/blog/dealing-with-deprecations) in general, so if you're already feeling frustrated, maybe it's good to take a look at that post first. Today, I want to focus on one deprecation in particular in PHP 8.2: deprecated dynamic properties.

So first things first, what are dynamic properties exactly? Well, they are properties that aren't present on a class' definition, but are set on objects of those classes dynamically, at runtime.

For example this `<hljs type>Post</hljs>` class doesn't have a `<hljs prop>name</hljs>` property, but nevertheless we set it at runtime:

```php
class Post
{
}

// …

$post = new <hljs type>Post</hljs>();

$post-><hljs prop>name</hljs> = 'Name';

<hljs prop>var_dump</hljs>($post-><hljs prop>name</hljs>); // 'Name'
```

As of PHP 8.2, these dynamic properties will be deprecated:

```php
// …

$post-><hljs striped>name</hljs> = 'Name';
```

You'll see this message: `Deprecated: Creation of dynamic property Post::$name is deprecated`.

## Implementing `<hljs prop>__get</hljs>` and `<hljs prop>__set</hljs>` still works!

You might be panicking at this point, because dynamic properties are a big part of meta programming in PHP — many frameworks rely on it!

Not to worry: this new deprecation won't affect any class that implements `<hljs prop>__get</hljs>` and `<hljs prop>__set</hljs>`. Classes that implement these magic methods will keep working as intended:

```php
class Post
{
    private <hljs type>array</hljs> <hljs prop>$properties</hljs> = [];

    public function __set(<hljs type>string</hljs> $name, <hljs type>mixed</hljs> $value): void
    {
        $this-><hljs prop>properties</hljs>[$name] = $value;
    }

    // …
}

// …

$post-><hljs prop>name</hljs> = 'Name';
```

The same goes for objects of `<hljs type>stdClass</hljs>`, they will support dynamic properties just as before:

```php
$object = new <hljs type>stdClass</hljs>();

$object-><hljs prop>name</hljs> = 'Name'; // Works fine in PHP 8.2
```

Now some clever readers might wonder: if `<hljs type>stdClass</hljs>` still allows dynamic properties, what would happen if you'd extend from it?

Indeed, it _is_ possible to extend from `<hljs type>stdClass</hljs>` to prevent the deprecation notice from being shown. However, I'd say this solution is far from ideal:

```php
// Don't do this

class Post extends <hljs type>stdClass</hljs>
{
}

$post = new <hljs type>Post</hljs>();

$post-><hljs prop>name</hljs> = 'Name'; // Works in PHP 8.2
```

## A better alternative

If you _really_ want to use dynamic properties without implementing `<hljs prop>__get</hljs>` and `<hljs prop>__set</hljs>`, there is a much better alternative than to extend from `<hljs type>stdClass</hljs>`.

The PHP core team has provided a built-in [attribute](/blog/attributes-in-php-8) called `<hljs type>AllowDynamicProperties</hljs>`. As its name suggests, it allows dynamic properties on classes, without having to rely on sketchy extends:

```php
#[<hljs type>\AllowDynamicProperties</hljs>]
class Post
{
}

$post = new <hljs type>Post</hljs>();

$post-><hljs prop>name</hljs> = 'Name'; // All fine
```

## Closing thoughts

PHP used to be a very dynamic language, but has been moving away from that mindset for a while now. Personally I think it's a good thing to embrace stricter rules and rely on static analysis wherever possible, as I find it leads to writing better code.

I can imagine developers who relied on dynamic properties, who are less happy with this change. If you're in that group, you might find it useful to take a closer look into static analysis. You can check out my [Road to PHP: Static Analysis](https://road-to-php.com/static) series if you want to learn more!

_If_ you're willing to invest some time in figuring out static analysis, I'm fairly certain that most of you won't ever want to return back to the mess that is a dynamic programming language. With PHP we're lucky that both options are available and that you can migrate gradually towards a stricter type system.

So, yes: this deprecation might be a little painful, but I believe it's for the best of the language to do so. And remember that it won't be a fatal error until PHP 9.0, so there's plenty of time to deal with it.
