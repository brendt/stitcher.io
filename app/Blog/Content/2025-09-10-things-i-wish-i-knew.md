Over the years, I've blogged a lot about my journey as a professional programmer: some wins, some losses, and many lessons learned. I always got a lot of positive response on those blogposts, so much so that I decided to write a book about the topic of "things I wish I knew when I started programming". 

This book is for every programmer out there, young or old. I was surprised to learn a couple of things about myself _while_ writing it, and I genuinely believe it'll have a positive impact on how you go about your programming journey.
