### Readonly classes <small>[RFC](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/readonly_classes)</small>

Readonly properties were [introduced in PHP 8.1](/blog/php-81-readonly-properties). This RFC builds on top of them, and adds syntactic sugar to make all class properties readonly at once. Instead of writing this:

```php
class Post
{
    public function __construct(
        <hljs keyword>public readonly</hljs> <hljs type>string</hljs> <hljs prop>$title</hljs>, 
        <hljs keyword>public readonly</hljs> <hljs type>Author</hljs> <hljs prop>$author</hljs>,
        <hljs keyword>public readonly</hljs> <hljs type>string</hljs> <hljs prop>$body</hljs>,
        <hljs keyword>public readonly</hljs> <hljs type>DateTime</hljs> <hljs prop>$publishedAt</hljs>,
    ) {}
}
```

You can now write this:

```php
<hljs keyword yellow>readonly</hljs> class Post
{
    public function __construct(
        <hljs keyword>public</hljs> <hljs type>string</hljs> <hljs prop>$title</hljs>, 
        <hljs keyword>public</hljs> <hljs type>Author</hljs> <hljs prop>$author</hljs>,
        <hljs keyword>public</hljs> <hljs type>string</hljs> <hljs prop>$body</hljs>,
        <hljs keyword>public</hljs> <hljs type>DateTime</hljs> <hljs prop>$publishedAt</hljs>,
    ) {}
}
```

Functionally, making a class readonly is entirely the same as making every property readonly; but it will also prevent dynamic properties being added on a class:

```php
$post = new <hljs type>Post</hljs>(/* … */);

$post-><hljs striped>unknown</hljs> = 'wrong';

<hljs red full>Uncaught Error: Cannot create dynamic property Post::$unknown</hljs>
```

Note that you can only extend from readonly classes if the child class is readonly as well.

PHP has changed quite a lot, and readonly classes are a welcome addition. You can take a look at my video about PHP's evolution if you want to as well:

### Deprecate dynamic properties <small>[RFC](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate_dynamic_properties)</small>

I'd say this is a change for the better, but it will hurt a little bit. Dynamic properties are deprecated in PHP 8.2, and will throw an `<hljs type>ErrorException</hljs>` in PHP 9.0:

```php
class Post
{
    public <hljs type>string</hljs> <hljs prop>$title</hljs>;
}

// …

$post-><hljs striped>name</hljs> = 'Name';
```

Keep in mind that classes implementing `<hljs prop>__get</hljs>` and `<hljs prop>__set</hljs>` will still work as intended:

```php
class Post
{
    private <hljs type>array</hljs> <hljs prop>$properties</hljs> = [];
    
    public function __set(<hljs type>string</hljs> $name, <hljs type>mixed</hljs> $value): void
    {
        $this-><hljs prop>properties</hljs>[$name] = $value;
    }
}

// …

$post-><hljs prop>name</hljs> = 'Name';
```

### New random extension <small>[RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/rng_extension)</small>

PHP 8.2 adds a new random number generator that fixes a lot of problems with the previous one: it’s more performant, more secure, it’s easier to maintain, and doesn’t rely on global state; eliminating a range of difficult to detect bugs when using PHP’s random functions.

There’s a new class called `<hljs type>Randomizer</hljs>`, which accepts a randomizer engine. Now you can change that engine, depending on your needs. For example, to differentiate between a production and testing environment.

```php
$rng = $is_production
    ? new <hljs type>Random\Engine\Secure</hljs>()
    : new <hljs type>Random\Engine\Mt19937</hljs>(1234);
 
$randomizer = new <hljs type>Random\Randomizer</hljs>($rng);
$randomizer-><hljs prop>shuffleString</hljs>('foobar');
```

### `<hljs type>null</hljs>`,  `<hljs type>true</hljs>`, and `<hljs type>false</hljs>` as standalone types <small>[RFC](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/null-false-standalone-types)</small>

PHP 8.2 adds three new types — or something that looks like it. We'll avoid going down the rabbit hole of [type safety](https://stitcher.io/blog/liskov-and-type-safety) in this post, but technically `<hljs type>null</hljs>`, `<hljs type>true</hljs>`, and `<hljs type>false</hljs>` could be considered valid types on their own. Common examples are PHP's built-in functions, where `<hljs type>false</hljs>` is used as the return type for when an error occurs. For example in `<hljs prop>file_get_contents</hljs>`:

```php
<hljs prop>file_get_contents</hljs>(/* … */): <hljs type>string|false</hljs>
```

Before PHP 8.2, you could already use `<hljs type>false</hljs>` together with other types as a union; but now it can be used as a standalone type as well:

```php
function alwaysFalse(): <hljs type>false</hljs>
{
    return false;
}
```

The same now also goes for `<hljs type>true</hljs>` and `<hljs type>null</hljs>`.

---

### Disjunctive Normal Form Types <small>[RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/dnf_types)</small>

DNF types allow us to combine [union](/blog/new-in-php-8#union-types-rfc) and [intersection](/blog/new-in-php-81#pure-intersection-types-rfc) types, following a strict rule: when combining union and intersection types, intersection types must be grouped with brackets.
In practice, that looks like this:

```php
function <hljs prop>generateSlug</hljs>((HasTitle&HasId)|null $post) 
{
    if ($post === null) {
        return '';
    }

    return 
        <hljs prop>strtolower</hljs>($post-><hljs prop>getTitle</hljs>()) 
        . $post-><hljs prop>getId</hljs>();
}
```

In this case, `(<hljs type>HasTitle</hljs>&<hljs type>HasId</hljs>)|<hljs type>null</hljs>` is the DNF type.

It's a nice addition, especially since it means that we can now have nullable intersection types, which is probably the most important use case for this feature.

---

### Constants in traits <small>[RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/constants_in_traits)</small>

You can now use constants in traits:

```php
trait <hljs type>Foo</hljs> 
{
    public const <hljs prop>CONSTANT</hljs> = 1;
 
    public function bar(): int 
    {
        return self::<hljs prop>CONSTANT</hljs>;
    }
}
```

You won't be able to access the constant via the trait's name, either from outside the trait, or from inside it.

```php
trait <hljs type>Foo</hljs> 
{
    public const <hljs prop>CONSTANT</hljs> = 1;
 
    public function bar(): int 
    {
        return <hljs striped><hljs type>Foo</hljs>::<hljs prop>CONSTANT</hljs></hljs>;
    }
}

<hljs striped><hljs type>Foo</hljs>::<hljs prop>CONSTANT</hljs></hljs>;
```

You can however access the constant via the class that uses the trait, given that it's public:

```php
class MyClass
{
    use Foo;
}

<hljs type>MyClass</hljs>::<hljs prop>CONSTANT</hljs>; // 1
```

---

### Redact parameters in back traces <small>[RFC](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/redact_parameters_in_back_traces)</small>

A common practice in any codebase is to send production errors to a service that keeps track of them, and will notify developers when something goes wrong. This practice often involves sending stack traces over the wire to a third party service. There are cases however where those stack traces can include sensitive information such as environment variables, passwords or usernames. 

PHP 8.2 allows you to mark such "sensitive parameters" with an attribute, so that you don't need to worry about them being listed in your stack traces when something goes wrong.
Here's an example from the RFC:

```php
function login(
    <hljs type>string</hljs> $user,
    #[<hljs type>\SensitiveParameter</hljs>] <hljs type>string</hljs> $password
) {
    // …
    
    throw new <hljs type>Exception</hljs>('Error');
}
 
<hljs prop>login</hljs>('root', 'root');
 
//<hljs error full>Fatal error: Uncaught Exception: Error in login.php:8
//Stack trace:
//#0 login.php(11): login('root', <hljs yellow>Object(SensitiveParameterValue)</hljs>)
//#1 {main}
//  thrown in login.php on line 8</hljs>
```

### Fetch properties of enums in const expressions <small>[RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/fetch_property_in_const_expressions)</small>

From the RFC:

> This RFC proposes to allow the use of `->`/`?->` to fetch properties of enums in constant expressions. The primary motivation for this change is to allow fetching the name and value properties in places where enum objects aren't allowed, like array keys

That means that the following code is now valid:

```php
<hljs keyword>enum</hljs> <hljs type>A</hljs>: <hljs type>string</hljs> 
{
    case <hljs prop>B</hljs> = 'B';
    
    const <hljs prop>C</hljs> = [<hljs yellow>self::<hljs prop>B</hljs>-><hljs prop>value</hljs></hljs> => self::<hljs prop>B</hljs>];
}
```

---

### Return type changes for `<hljs type>DateTime</hljs>::<hljs prop>createFromImmutable</hljs>()` and `<hljs type>DateTimeImmutable</hljs>::<hljs prop>createFromMutable</hljs>()` <small class="breaking">[breaking](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/UPGRADING#L22-L26)</small>

Previously, these methods looked like this:

```php
<hljs type>DateTime</hljs>::<hljs prop>createFromImmutable</hljs>(): <hljs type>DateTime</hljs>
<hljs type>DateTimeImmutable</hljs>::<hljs prop>createFromMutable</hljs>(): <hljs type>DateTimeImmutable</hljs>
```

In PHP 8.2 those method signatures are changed like so:

```php
<hljs type>DateTime</hljs>::<hljs prop>createFromImmutable</hljs>(): <hljs type>static</hljs>
<hljs type>DateTimeImmutable</hljs>::<hljs prop>createFromMutable</hljs>(): <hljs type>static</hljs>
```

This change makes a lot more sense, as it improves static insight possibilities for classes extending from `<hljs type>DateTime</hljs>` and `<hljs type>DateTimeImmutable</hljs>`. However, technically, this is a breaking change that might affect custom implementations that extend from either of those two classes.

### `<hljs prop>utf8_encode</hljs>()` and `<hljs prop>utf8_decode</hljs>()` deprecations <small>[RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_utf8_decode_and_utf8_encode)</small>

In PHP 8.2, using either `<hljs prop>utf8_encode</hljs>()` or `<hljs prop>utf8_decode</hljs>()` will trigger these deprecation notices:

```txt
<hljs error full>Deprecated: Function utf8_encode() is deprecated
Deprecated: Function utf8_decode() is deprecated</hljs>
```

The RFC argues that these functions have a inaccurate name that often causes confusion: these functions only convert between `ISO-8859-1` and `UTF-8`, while the function name suggest a more broader use. There's a more detailed explanation about the reasoning in the [RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_utf8_decode_and_utf8_encode).

The alternative? The RFC suggests using `<hljs prop>mb_convert_encoding</hljs>()` instead.

---

### Locale-insensitive `<hljs prop>strtolower</hljs>()` and `<hljs prop>strtoupper</hljs>()` <small class="breaking">[breaking](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/UPGRADING#L41-L47)</small> <small>[RFC](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/strtolower-ascii)</small>

Both `<hljs prop>strtolower</hljs>()` and `<hljs prop>strtoupper</hljs>()` are no longer locale-sensitive. You can use `<hljs prop>mb_strtolower</hljs>()` if you want localized case conversion.

--- 

### Signature changes to several SPL methods <small class="breaking">[breaking](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/UPGRADING#L49-L60)</small> 

Several methods of SPL classes have been changed to properly enforce their correct type signature:

```php
<hljs type>SplFileInfo</hljs>::<hljs prop>_bad_state_ex</hljs>()
<hljs type>SplFileObject</hljs>::<hljs prop>getCsvControl</hljs>()
<hljs type>SplFileObject</hljs>::<hljs prop>fflush</hljs>()
<hljs type>SplFileObject</hljs>::<hljs prop>ftell</hljs>()
<hljs type>SplFileObject</hljs>::<hljs prop>fgetc</hljs>()
<hljs type>SplFileObject</hljs>::<hljs prop>fpassthru</hljs>()
<hljs type>SplFileObject</hljs>::<hljs prop>hasChildren</hljs>()
<hljs type>SplFileObject</hljs>::<hljs prop>getChildren</hljs>()
```

### New `n` modifier in PCRE <small>[upgrading](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/UPGRADING#L95-L100)</small>

You can now use the `n` modifier (`NO_AUTO_CAPTURE`) in `pcre*` functions.

---

### ODBC username and password escaping <small class="breaking">[breaking](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/UPGRADING#L28-L39)</small>

From the [UPGRADING](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/UPGRADING#L28-L39) guide:

> The `ODBC` extension now escapes the username and password for the case when
both a connection string and username/password are passed, and the string
must be appended to.

The same applies to `PDO_ODBC`.

### Deprecate `${}` string interpolation <small>[RFC](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate_dollar_brace_string_interpolation)</small>

PHP has several ways of embedding variables in strings. This RFC deprecates two ways of doing so, since they are rarely used, and often lead to confusion:

```php
"Hello <hljs striped>${world}</hljs>";
//<hljs red full>Deprecated: Using ${} in strings is deprecated</hljs>
 
"Hello <hljs striped>${(<hljs prop>world</hljs>)}</hljs>";
//<hljs red full>Deprecated: Using ${} (variable variables) in strings is deprecated</hljs>
```

To be clear: the two popular ways of string interpolation still work:

```php
"Hello {$world}";
"Hello $world";
```

---

### Deprecate partially supported callables <small>[RFC](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate_partially_supported_callables)</small>

Another change, although one with a slightly smaller impact, is that partially supported callables are now deprecated as well. Partially supported callables are callables which can be called using `<hljs prop>call_user_func</hljs>($callable)`, but not by calling `$callable()` directly. The list of these kinds of callables is rather short, by the way:

```php
"self::method"
"parent::method"
"static::method"
["self", "method"]
["parent", "method"]
["static", "method"]
["Foo", "Bar::method"]
[<hljs keyword>new</hljs> <hljs type>Foo</hljs>, "Bar::method"]
```

The reason for doing this? It's a step in the right direction towards being able to use `<hljs type>callable</hljs>` for typed properties. Nikita explains it very well in the RFC:

> all of these callables are context-dependent. The method that "self::method" refers to depends on which class the call or callability check is performed from. In practice, this usually also holds for the last two cases, when used in the form of [new Foo, "parent::method"].
>
> Reducing the context-dependence of callables is the secondary goal of this RFC. After this RFC, the only scope-dependence still left is method visibility: "Foo::bar" may be visible in one scope, but not another. If callables were to be limited to public methods in the future (while private methods would have to use first-class callables or Closure::fromCallable() to be made scope-independent), then the callable type would become well-defined and could be used as a property type. However, changes to visibility handling are not proposed as part of this RFC.
