It's only been two weeks since I announced I'm [starting a newsletter](/blog/starting-a-newsletter), 
and here I am again with something new: a podcast.

People who know me IRL know I listen to _lots_ of podcasts every day.
I did some internet radio a few years ago, and since then always wanted to pick it up again.

Ever since my wife and I bought our house, I've slowly been working on my amateur "studio", 
and I've come to the point where I feel comfortable recording in it.
Here's my view when recording:

Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I'm starting this thing. 
Just like the newsletter it'll be sporadic. 
I prefer quality over quantity, so don't expect anything weekly.

I called it "Rant With Brent", and if you'd ask me to summarize, 
I'd say it's a no-nonsense, straight to the point podcast about programming.
I don't want to waste 30 minutes of your time, when the same could be said in 10.

I do my best to make an episode highly informative and worth your time.
If you want to give it a chance,
you can find the podcast on [iTunes](*https://podcasts.apple.com/be/podcast/rant-with-brent/id1462956030), [Stitcher](*https://www.stitcher.com/s?fid=403581&refid=stpr.) and [Spotify](*https://open.spotify.com/show/43sF0kY3BWepaO9CkLvVdJ?si=R-MIXaMHQbegQyq3gQm7Yw).
