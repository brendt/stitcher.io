It's 2024, and I'm excited about PHP. Will some people think I'm weird because of that? Sure. Do I have good reasons to be excited about a programming language that's been around for more than 25 years, which generally has a reputation of being the underdog compared to other languages?

Absolutely! 

There _are_ very good reasons to be excited about PHP these days. Today, I want to share some of the things I'm most excited about this year for PHP.

## Continuous evolution

When Nikita left over two years ago — Nikita being _the_ main contributor and driver for PHP, he went to work on LLVM — I'll admit I was [scared for PHP's future](/blog/php-in-2022):

> I'm a little worried now that Nikita has stepped down. He's definitely not the only person capable of working on PHP's core, but he _did_ a tremendous amount of work these past years with PHP 8.0 and 8.1.
> I don't think 2022 will be the most mind blowing year for PHP, but rather a year of adding stability.

Looking back, I think that fear wasn't needed. The [PHP Foundation](https://thephp.foundation/) has grown into a well-established community, with now 10 developers being paid to work on PHP core. Two major features being worked on at the moment come to mind: [property hooks](https://rfc.stitcher.io/rfc/property-hooks) — which I'm hopeful for will pass once it comes to voting; and a [rework of Pecl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWsGDUCxbT0) — PHP's extension manager.

Of course, I still got a sliver of hope when it comes to generics, which the Foundation is/was also looking into. I do think that the only viable way forward is [runtime-ignored generics](/blog/we-dont-need-runtime-type-checks) though, time will tell whether the Foundation will be able to cultivate a new mindset or not.

## FrankenPHP

One of the cool things happening in PHP land today is a project called [FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev/). It's been in the works for a year or two — if I remember correctly, and it's getting some real traction these days.

FrankenPHP is an app server for PHP, written in Go, that gives existing PHP apps a major performance boost, and it's super easy to get started with. It also supports compiling PHP projects as standalone binaries, worker mode for long-lived applications, is three times faster than PHP-FPM, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support, and more.

Recently, we've seen support for FrankenPHP for [Laravel](https://blog.laravel.com/octane-frankenphp) and [Symfony](https://github.com/php-runtime/frankenphp-symfony). So it's growing into something big.

## Laravel

I think it's fair to say at this point that Laravel's marketing strategy is working well. Laravel itself — [the open source framework](https://laravel.com/) — is by far the most popular one within the PHP community; but they've also managed to create an ecosystem of products built with and for Laravel, to build a sustainable business. Just recently, Laravel [hired 6 new people](https://twitter.com/taylorotwell/status/1768417227202613437), from a COO to BizOps to engineers; and Taylor mentioned that "serious business is underway". 

Modern businesses are growing and embracing PHP, which is great to see.  

One of the things I embraced last year was [Laravel Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/), a tool that allows you to write interactive apps, without any JavaScript. I did some tinkering with it, and had a lot of fun making a game:

## Discovering PHP

What I found especially heartwarming to see is how people outside the PHP community are re-discovering PHP. There have been a number of examples of people coming from the JavaScript world, suddenly [realising Laravel is a thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Spwv0RbITmE), and a _good_ thing; and there are people like ThePrimeagen on YouTube who were pleasantly surprised by PHP:

## Composer and Packagist

The PHP ecosystem keeps growing as well: there's a continuous growth in packages, indicating an active ecosystem.

On top of that, Packagist recently crossed the **one hundred billion downloads** milestone. That's a [doubling in two years time](/blog/php-in-2022#the-ecosystem)! We're now at **105 134 384 876**, and that number keeps growing.

I think it's fair to say: **PHP is not dead**!
