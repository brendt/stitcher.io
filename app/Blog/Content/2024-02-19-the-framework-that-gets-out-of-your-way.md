Half a year ago, I wrote this:

If you haven't heard of that framework before â€” it's called Tempest â€” you could check out me building the foundations of it during [several livestreams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0bgkxUS9EaILnUL8Q4np6B3qxjQbE7PH).

I had a break working on Tempest for a couple of months because of other projects, but recently I started diving into it again. I've actually used it to build a small website, and let me tell you: I really enjoyed it.

That probably shouldn't come as a surprise since I built it the way I like to build things. But still, I was very happy seeing all pieces fit together so perfectly. Granted: there is a lot more fine-tuning to do, but I do think there's some potential here.

To be clear: Tempest doesn't aim to replace any frameworks like Laravel or Symfony; but for getting smaller PHP websites up and running? I feel like there's a lot of potential for a small and modern framework.

I especially like how Tempest gets out of your way. There's no need for config files or any setup, Tempest understands your code. I'm not kidding, [it works really well](https://twitter.com/brendt_gd/status/1757043283656667420).

So, I'd say go check out a very pre-alpha version of what undoubtedly will become something great in the future: [https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework).

## On a personal note

Much to my frustration, I've been sick since mid-December. Nothing serious, just a very annoying cough that doesn't want to go away. I've seen my doctor numerous times, a specialist, I'm using an inhaler, nasal spray, tried antacids, nothing seems to work. I actually have had the same issue for multiple years now: periods of coughing without any clear reason or solution.

Like I said, it's not too serious, just an annoying cough that doesn't want to go away, though it is very limiting when trying to record videos or audio. The more I talk, the worse it gets, so proper recording sessions aren't really an option right now. That three-minute video about Tempest I linked a couple paragraphs ago took waaaaay too much time and editing to get all the coughs outâ€¦

That's why I've been rather quiet on [PHP Annotated](https://www.youtube.com/@phpannotated), and why I've mostly focussed on writing content for PhpStorm lately. Last week, the first post in a series about JetBrains' [AI Assistant for Unit Testing](https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2024/02/ai-for-php-how-to-automate-unit-testing-using-ai-assistant/) went live, and I've got a couple more scheduled soon.

I _really_ hope my coughing gets over soon, and I _really_ hope we'll find a proper solution. I've got another doctor's appointment scheduled next week and hope new medication will have a better impact.

Anyway, I mainly wanted to share this with you in case people were wondering why PHP Annotated is so quiet lately. I really want to get back into it a soon as possible though!

That's it for today's newsletter, do check out [Tempest](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework) _and give it a star while you're there_ ðŸ˜‰

Until next time

PS: I feel real inspired to livestream today. I'm still coughing, but I hope I'll manage. Come say hi:
