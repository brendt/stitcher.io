My colleague [Willem](*https://mobile.twitter.com/willemvbockstal) always amazes me: the backend developer; 
with his insights into design. 
It's he who recommended following a blog —&thinsp;it's more like a newsletter&thinsp;— about web typography.

This course broadened the way I think about fonts, and it's the primary reason my own blog, this blog; looks the way it does.
Whether you're a frontend or backend dev, everyone should have basic knowledge about typography, 
and I'd recommend following the course over at [betterwebtype.com](*https://betterwebtype.com) to do so.
