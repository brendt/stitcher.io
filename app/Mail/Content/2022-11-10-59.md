title: 'PHP Annotated, 8.2 and Twitter'
---

Hi there, welcome to a new edition of my newsletter!

## PHP 8.2 delayed

The news just came in yesterday: PHP 8.2 will be delayed for another two weeks and release on **December 8, 2022**. 

There are a couple of reasons listed in the [official message](https://externals.io/message/118991): some critical bugs were found last-minute that should be fixed and postponing until after Thanksgiving gives a bit more flexibility.

I would say it's a good and healthy development to keep quality over deadlines!

## PHP Annotated

I've got some amazing news! Together with JetBrains, I've rebranded [my YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@phpannotated) channel: it's now entirely focussed on the PHP community, and I'll be able to work on it as my job! 

We've got some amazing content coming up, so definitely go subscribe if you're into video content. The first video is already available: [What's new in PHP 8.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBcZIY_v9VQ&ab_channel=PHPAnnotated).

Now don't worry: the [PHP Annotated newsletter](https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/tag/php-annotated-monthly/) by my colleague Roman isn't going away. I will also keep posting newsletters, blogposts, etc; so besides being able to create more and better content, nothing will change :) 

## Roundup

I ran into some interesting links over the past weeks that I'd like to share as well; I've got some questions for you at the end by the way.

- **[How to Get Insanely Rich in the Creator Economy](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/57d34094-3164-4c19-b54a-7e08e831bfc9)** — An amazing satire post about the content creator industry. So many things resonate with me in this post, and I really need to be careful to not fall in the traps it describes.
- **[Apple fired 4,100 employees when Steve Jobs returned in 1997](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/74178940-bacf-4b4d-ba88-fee8623326e5)** — some interesting thoughts about how Apple came to rise again. Especially [Jobs' answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeqPrUmVz-o&ab_channel=JonathanField) when he was criticised felt so powerful to me. I don't think you can compare it one-to-one with what happened at Twitter recently though. I can also imagine that being among the many layoffs at Twitter is so painful on a personal level. On its own though, Steve's mentally of "making mistakes and to learn from them" is gold.
- **[Is this the last exodus from Twitter?](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/2d2a5779-e560-4247-98c5-b0b9a2774a21)** — To bring some balance to the board again: Hidde is explaining why he's leaving Twitter. I'll admit I also thought hard about how to reach my audience in the coming years. Twitter has always been my primary, first-line communication channel; but maybe that should change? I've got an amazing newsletter here, possibly that should become my primary form of communication? No worries though: I won't start sending emails every day. However, I would very much like to know your thoughts: **what should be my primary communication channel? Why?**

With all of that being said, I wish you a great weekend and new week, and I'll talk to you soon!

Until next time

Brent
