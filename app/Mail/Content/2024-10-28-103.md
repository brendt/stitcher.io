Hi ::subscriber.first_name::

It's been a while, I know! I haven't been silent on this mailing list out of laziness though: September and October have been two super productive months, and I was so busy focused on two big projects, alongside my daytime job, that I didn't take the time to sit down and write to you. So at last, here I am!

First, I want to talk about **Tempest**: as you're reading this, we're very close to tagging the third alpha release: it's scheduled for October 31. In my previous email, we hadn't even tagged the first alpha release, so I realize it's a big jump forward ðŸ˜…

However, I'm so excited about it! We've worked all throughout October: 13 people contributed to this release, and we merged over 60 pull requests. All that works results in features like package installers, a defer helper, a proper cache layer, code generator, improvements to the container, eventbus, router, and so much more. Working on Tempest has been a blast: I never expected so much enthusiasm so early on in the project, and I'm grateful seeing this framework grow into something real.

When I tagged alpha 1, my goal was to figure out if Tempest can be _a thing_. By now, it's pretty clear that it is and will be, and I'm excited for the months to come as we're working towards a stable 1.0 release.

If Tempest has peaked your interest, I would say: take a look at the [Tempest website](https://tempestphp.com/)! And, of course, feel free to reply to this email if you have any questions!

But I said I had _two_ big things to be excited about, right? The second thing might even be bigger news: I mentioned in previous newsletter how I was writing a sci-fi novel. Well as of today, that book, **[Timeline Taxi, has been published](https://timeline-taxi.com/)**!

I realize not all of you are here to read about my sci-fi novel writing, but I'm really proud of it, and I hope at least some of you will enjoy it. So take a look at [the website](https://timeline-taxi.com/) if you're interested, and let me know your thoughts by replying to this email.

Those were my two big things of October, and I'm really proud of both, thanks for allowing me to share them with you! Have a great and productive week, maybe Tempest and/or Timeline Taxi can be a part of it!

Until next time

Brent

PS: I've made the Timeline Taxi website in Tempest, and used event sourcing for it, just because I could ðŸ˜… I did a livestream on it a couple of days ago, which you might enjoy as well! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr339AKcxT0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr339AKcxT0)
