## Why PHP?

Isn't that a good question to ask? I did exactly that in my latest YouTube video: why do I love PHP? 

I talk and write a lot about modern PHP, so you might guess it's because of its syntax or performance. But honestly? The number one reason I love PHP is about something entirely different.

Take a look! Oh and, also leave a comment on YouTube if you want to? Let us know why _you_ love PHP!

I'm in LOVE with a BORING language!

## RFC Vote

In other news, we've been hard at work over at the [RFC Vote](https://github.com/brendt/rfc-vote) project. It's been two weeks since I wrote about it, and wow! So many people pitched in! We now have a list of [all contributors](https://rfc.stitcher.io/about) on the about page. Apart from that change, there's too much to list: already [116 merged pull requests](https://github.com/brendt/rfc-vote/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged)! 

I'm really looking forward to when "RFC season" starts again, so that we can truly start using this platform!

By the way, I'm streaming once again in less than an hour, come say hi if you want to:
