title: 'Game Changing Editions'
pretext: "A deep diver into my number one wishlist feature for PHP"

Hi ::subscriber.first_name::

I just published a blog post about — what I think — might be a game changer for PHP. It's based on the work Nikita Popov did years ago (before he left PHP), and I think it's the key to move PHP forward.

I'm talking about [adding opt-in breaking changes in PHP](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/posts/73775). The idea is based on Rust's Editions, and I wrote down my preliminary thoughts about it. There is so much more to be done, and I'm really looking forward to hearing from you as well. If you have the time, I'd really appreciate it if you read through the post and shared your thoughts about it, either in the comments or by replying to this email.

For my part, I'm going to speak to some Foundation members, to see whether there's some actual interest in reviving Nikita's old RFC as a first step. I'll keep you posted!

## From the feed

- [Lessons learned from the deep end](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/posts/73771) — I really appreciate the openness of the Spatie team about how they have to rethink their plans when Laravel came with their own error tracker. A fascinating read.
- [Pitch in: sponsoring open source](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/posts/73721) — I led an initiative for open source sponsorships at PhpStorm, and my hope is that it might inspire others to follow suit.
- [Disasters in a microservices world](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/posts/73726)
- [What caused the large AWS outage?](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/posts/73706)
- [The new context managers RFC](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/posts/73744) — A very interesting new RFC
- [RE: The journey this far](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/posts/73720) — I reacted to someone's first impression of using Tempest. It was really valuable.
- [PHP Design contest results](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/posts/73745) — my favorite didn't win, but that's ok.

That's it for today, see you next time!
