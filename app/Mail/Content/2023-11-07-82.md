Hello ::subscriber.first_name::

Things seldom go as planned, right? For example: it's my 8-year wedding anniversary today, and my wife and I had planned to go on a date while the kids were at school. However: one of said kids got a nasty stomach bug yesterday. So instead of dating, we were stuck at home taking care of him and quite a lot of cleaning up — I'll spare you the details.

While we had to postpone our date plans, PHP 8.3's release day seems to be on track: there's one more release candidate planned this week, and then it should be released November 23rd! So, my wife and I will reschedule our anniversary date, but how about you and I schedule a celebration date for PHP's release as well? I plan on doing a **livestream to celebrate PHP's new release on November 23rd, at 13:00 CET**, and to look back on some awesome features of the past as well. I'd love to get some people in chat, so you definitely want to write that date down in your calendar. Let's hope there won't be any sick kids to mess up our plans 😁

Apart from our celebration date, there's another livestream I wanted to let you know about. I've been building RFC Vote on stream for the last couple of months, and I plan to do another stream this Thursday. I'll sit together with **Nuno Maduro, the creator of Pest**, to talk about his revolutionary testing framework, and to convert the test suite of RFC Vote to Pest! You can join us live in two days **[via this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vjjht-DMX3s)**.

By the way, definitely consider to **[subscribe on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@phpannotated)** if you haven't.

Speaking of RFC Vote, I just published a new RFC for everyone to vote on: the **[Property Hooks RFC](https://rfc.stitcher.io/rfc/property-hooks)**. I think it's a fascinating one, and I'm curious to learn how the community feels about it. 

One final thing I have to share is about that little hobby project I mentioned in my previous newsletter, that dungeon-crawler, deck-building game. I've been doing some play testing with a couple of friends, and am close to the point where I want to invite a couple more people. If you're interested to take a look, you can hit reply to let me know. Oh, I also made a small [tutorial-like video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzPezBczGrU&ab_channel=TheDungeon) for it, just in case you want to know what it's all about. 

That's all I have for you today, looking forward to seeing you on stream, or reading your replies via email!

Until next time
