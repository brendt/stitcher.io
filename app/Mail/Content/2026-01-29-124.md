Hi ::subscriber.first_name::

For two weeks, I've been working on optimizing a PHP script. At first, it would take around 5 days to complete. Eventually I got that number down to less than a minute. It's been quite an interesting journey, and I shared the first part already with you last week. 

This week, though, I picked things up where I left them and managed to increase performance from processing 50,000 rows per second to **1.7 million rows per second**. And even though that number is mind-blowing, I actually think there is more room for improvement still 🫣 Nevertheless, it was time to share a progress update, so here we are. You can read about all the new things I did in [this new blog post](https://stitcher.io/feed/posts/74125).

In other news, I also finally sat down to write my in-depth look at a new feature that's coming to PHP 8.6: [partial function application](https://stitcher.io/feed/posts/74124).

```php
$output = $input 
    |> trim(?)
    |> str_replace(' ', '-', ?)
    |> str_replace(['.', '/', '…'], '', ?)
    |> strtolower(?);
```

Opinions seem to vary from absolute love to hate, and I'm curious to hear your thoughts about it as well? I think I really like it, although maybe time and practice will have to prove that for sure.

Finally, I also posted [a random thought about AI in my blog](https://stitcher.io/feed/posts/74122). I'm curious to hear your feeling on the topic as well. 

That's it for this one, have a wonderful rest of the week!

Until next time

Brent
