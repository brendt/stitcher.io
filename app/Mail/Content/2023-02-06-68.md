title: 'February Roundup'
---

Something that has always bothered me about reading on the internet is how quickly I forget about great content. I might have read an awesomely inspiring blog post last month; chances are slim I'll remember anything of it in a year.

Luckily, I have [Aggregate](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/), where I keep track of everything I've read (since I started the project), and so last week, I wrote some code that will suggest "old but good posts" to me. It'll take some time to fine-tune the system to my liking, but it's somewhat reassuring knowing I won't lose track of great content and can re-read it from time to time.

You'll notice I'll share the odd "old" post from time to time in my roundups; I hope you enjoy them as well!

## Roundup

- **[I'm a code folder](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/522257a3-913f-48e8-9457-76c5786679e1)** — This is my latest blog-post-to-video that I published a couple of days ago. It takes less than two minutes to watch, and I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback.
- **[Prompting for missing input in Artisan commands](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/ddb8a9da-26ea-4596-bbe8-9a760f271d77)** — Luke writes about a very nice addition in Laravel where Artisan will ask about missing input arguments.
- **[Building APIs in Laravel](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/53df60fc-594a-4d31-8302-f884aa41548b)** — Steve has been writing some great in-depth tutorials over at Laravel News lately. This post fits in nicely. 
- **[Kickstarting TikTok: 55,500 Followers & 7m views in 6 Weeks](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/9ba1de47-f327-4598-acf2-01109066f772)** — TikTok is so weird, and yet it seems to be so popular. This is an interesting post about how someone grew their TikTok audience. I wonder how it would translate to technical content. Are you on TikTok? How do you like it?
- **[My favourite way of testing validation rules](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/e31c928d-a9a6-43c8-b2e0-8537fc97feb5)** — Another post by Luke about how he tests validation rules with Pest. I'm still on the PHPUnit side, but I have to admit: Pest does some really nice things!
- **[PHP Core Roundup #9](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/5a759825-c63f-4eac-86e5-77efb5d7bbf9)** — The PHP Foundation keeps doing consistent work. I look forward to seeing what PHP 8.3 will bring! (There already are some RFCs listed in that post.)
- **[My clean and minimalistic PhpStorm setup](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/31dff57e-20d2-4dc8-92b7-4886c79a0f8d)** — This is an older post of mine; I've been using the same setup for years now. 
- **[How I Accidentally Deleted 7TB of Videos Before Going To Production](https://web.archive.org/web/20220505100521/https://blog.thevinter.com/posts/vimeo)** — The original post got deleted, probably because of some NDA issues, but luckily nothing on the web ever gets lost :)
- **[The evolution of null](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/3543dc2b-11ed-46ea-97ac-d5d1bdad7200)** — I made a video on the PHP Annotated channel about how PHP itself has evolved in dealing with null. I like all the rich syntax we have today!

That's all for today; enjoy your week!
