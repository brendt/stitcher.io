Hi ::subscriber.first_name::

I worked on a pretty interesting problem for the past few days: I had to process millions of database rows and wanted to do it in minutes instead of hours or days. With some help, I went from processing 30 to 50,000 rows per second and dropping the total runtime from around 50 hours to an hour or so. It was a really fun exercise, and [I documented the process here](https://stitcher.io/feed/posts/74121).

Now I have to say one thing: some people reached out to me saying that I could have solved this purely on the database level or by using other languages and tools. Someone said I was "bragging my bicycle goes 40 km/h downhill after removing the training wheels, while ClickHouse is doing mach 3 on the same data with one query planner pass". 

To me, that's comparing apples to oranges. There's a place and time for any tool; for my use-case, on my blog, PHP is definitely the choice that makes most sense. My goal wasn't to get the absolute best speed possible in the universe, it was to see how much I could optimize a problem within some fixed boundaries; and I'm happy I was able to do that!

Let me know your thoughts, you can always reply to this email if you want to!
