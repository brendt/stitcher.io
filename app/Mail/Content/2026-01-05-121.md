title: 'Disconnected'
pretext: "Thoughts on starting a new year"

Hi ::subscriber.first_name::

Writing this email required me to write `2026` for the very first time. That's because, for the past three weeks, I spent disconnected from most online-related activities — how great that has been. Long-time subscribers might remember my writings about burnout back in July 2023, and during that period I learned a valuable new practice: to truly step away from my computer for a while.

These days I'm nowhere near burnout, which is exactly why I decided to disconnect _now_ instead of later. I rather stay ahead of any problems instead of being overwhelmed by them. And wow, do I feel refreshed! During those three weeks, I think I spent a total of 5 minutes thinking about work, and maybe 10 minutes about Tempest. I spent my time with my wife, kids, and family; I played a game (Don't Starve, it's an older game, it's really good), I did a lot of reading, as well as some writing for the second part of my sci-fi novel. And that's about it. 

I would say it's so worth it, and I hope you've enjoyed a break as well. Let me know what you did! 

Now, what does 2026 bring for me? For starters, I really want to be more active on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@phpannotated) again. I already started doing a lot more livestreams at the end of December, but I also want to make a proper effort for high-quality video content as well. First up will be a "PHP in 2026" video that I'm starting to work on this week.

Then there's [Tempest](https://tempestphp.com/), of course, for which I think 2026 will be a massive year. The community has never been more active as today, and the framework is getting more and more traction. Currently, we're working towards the 3.0 release, and I keep being amazed by the number of talented people pitching in. Tempest even got a mention on a recent [PHP RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/stringable-enums), which I think is really cool!

When it comes to my blog, I have a handful of drafts lined up; but as always: I write when I feel like it, so who knows when I'll finish them. I also plan on writing a book this year, although it'll be the second part of my [sci-fi novel](https://timeline-taxi.com/), so nothing tech related.

Finally, there'll be another [PHPVerse](https://lp.jetbrains.com/phpverse-2025/) this year in June, I'll keep you posted about it in the coming months!

That's it for my personal update; I hope you didn't mind my ramblings too much. Let me finish this newsletter with some interesting content from my feed.
