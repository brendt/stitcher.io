Hi there! 

Today I want to experiment with a slightly different approach to this newsletter. I don't want to focus on _my_ content alone but also share interesting stuff others have writing and tweeting about. I don't know if this is something I want to continue or not yet, so let me know your thoughts by hitting that reply button!

## Roundup!

- **[What I would change about PHP](https://stitcher.io/blog/php-reimagined-part-2)** — a short list of things I would like to see different in PHP, in no particular order. Some people will count them lucky that I have nothing to say in the matter 😅
- **[Cloning objects with overwritten readonly properties](https://twitter.com/nicolasgrekas/status/1562329055453642752)** — Nicolas is proposing an alternative to `clone with {}` for PHP 8.3.  
- **[Event Sourcing in Laravel](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/b6836dc4-6f14-4cc7-9982-3ce82e8ed602)** — Steve wrote an in-depth article about event sourcing.
- **[Composer 2.4 release](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/5f545908-2d6f-4bd3-ae8a-e03f6c90788a)** — There's a new composer version with a couple of nice features.

- **[Stop mocking about](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/a4fb0e13-0152-42ad-a928-d9e7b619b67f)** — Doeke is starting a new series to promote using less or no mocks while testing. I'm in the no-mocking club!
