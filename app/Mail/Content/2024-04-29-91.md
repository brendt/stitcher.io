Hi ::subscriber.first_name::

This will be a shorter email, but I promised I'd let you about the upcoming livestream with Larry, the co-author of property hooks. I'll sit down with him tomorrow, at 8 PM CEST, you can check out [the livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULUrhIrjyAg) to know what time that is for you. 

There will be room for your questions, so definitely come say hi in chat, and ask whatever comes to mind. I'm super looking forward to talking to such an experienced developer as Larry, and I hope to see you there as well! 

Finally, I remade an old video of mine to include property hooks, and I would very much like to hear your thoughts on it, give it a watch if you have 3 minutes to spare: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_6ewdiwnRo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_6ewdiwnRo)

See you tomorrow?
