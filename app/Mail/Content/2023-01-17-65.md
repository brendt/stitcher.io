title: 'PHP in 2023'
---

Hi there!

Every year, I write a post about the current overall state of PHP. I can't cover everything, but I try my best to paint an accurate image of the current PHP ecosystem. I'm happy to say that that post was just published, and you can read it right now: **[PHP in 2023](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/links/83abb4db-4dbd-468b-a9f5-b6e0b42f698b)**.

## Roundup

I wanted to share a couple of interesting posts I came across this past month, enjoy!

- **[Clever Code Considered Harmful](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/links/980f7a12-7e4b-41ab-9bb0-ae653d7b243e)** — Josh Comeau is at it again with a great blog post about clean code.
- **[How to communicate effectively as a developer](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/links/64e9035c-27db-445e-b726-89e716f9a2d9)** — I think soft skills like communication is so important in our line of work.
