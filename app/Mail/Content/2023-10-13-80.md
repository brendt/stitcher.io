Hi there!

This is a quick email letting you know that I'll be giving a talk about Generics in PHP on DPC (Dutch PHP Conference, which despite its name, is English 😁).

It's a free, online conference happening today, so you can join right away. If you want to say hi, you can head over to [https://www.phpconference.nl/](https://www.phpconference.nl/), press the "Register" button, and you'll be on your way.

I hope to see you there!

Brent
