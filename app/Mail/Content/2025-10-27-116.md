title: 'PHP 8.5 Release Page Design'
pretext: 'The foundation is hosting a competition, and the shortlist was just published.'
---

A couple of weeks ago, the Foundation announced a [design contest](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2025/10/01/design-contest/) for people to come up with a design for the upcoming PHP 8.5 release page. Around 15 entries have been selected, and now it's time to vote (you can vote as well)! All the designs are [listed here](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/posts/73718), and you can vote by leaving a thumbs-up on the comment with the entry you like most.

Now, my personal favorite is [Hanna's entry](https://github.com/php/web-php/issues/1563#issuecomment-3450440378), but you let me know which one you like the most. Whatever design gets chosen, I'm looking forward to PHP 8.5's release (and I plan on making content about it soon).

In other news, I wanted to let you know that I'll be speaking at two meetups in November: [PHP Antwerp](https://www.meetup.com/php-antwerp/events/310360847/) and [PHP & Laravel Development Eindhoven](https://www.meetup.com/php-laravel-eindhoven/events/311687181/); on top of that, I'll be at [SymfonyCon Amsterdam](https://live.symfony.com/2025-amsterdam-con/) a week later. If you happen to be around, please come say hi, and I might even have a gift for you if you mention reading this email ðŸ˜‰

## From the feed

Let's continue good traditions by sharing some of my content highlights from around the web these past weeks.

- [Nullable cast operators](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/posts/73712) is a new RFC that makes a lot of sense. 
- [Creating animated code snippets with Tempest Highlight & PHP-GLFW](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/posts/73704): an interesting demo of someone using tempest/highlight to create animated code snippets.
- [Build Your Own Database](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/posts/73701): teaching you have to build a database from absolute scratch. 
- [The state of PHP 2025](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/posts/73436): the yearly JetBrains dev ecosystem survey results are published, and I helped the PhpStorm team to write about PHP specifically.
- [Reducing code motion](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/posts/73699): this is a random thought I wrote down on my blog. Reddit seemed to not like it, which is fine. Maybe you have some thoughts about it as well?
- [To Be Useful You Must Risk Offending](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/posts/73703): interesting point of view of sharing your thoughts, event when you know people may disagree.

As always: don't hesitate to hit reply and share your thoughts!

Until next time
