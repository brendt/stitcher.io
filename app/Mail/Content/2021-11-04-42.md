title: 'Generics in PHP'
---

Hi there!

I've got something new to share with you today: I've redecorated my home office these past weeks and felt inspired to do some more recordings. I've been recording off and on for the past two years for all the courses we made [at Spatie](https://spatie.be/products), and I felt like I wanted to further improve my editing, composition and speaking skills.

So, consider this _a test_, I'm not sure if I'll do any more videos; but this one was fun to make nevertheless. Make sure to hit reply to share your feedback if you want to!

Without further ado, here I am talking about generics!

Until next time!

PS: also reply if you have an opinion about the problem I talk about in the video, would love to further discuss this!
