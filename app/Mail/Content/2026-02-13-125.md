Hi ::subscriber.first_name::

It feels like it's been a while since I wrote about [Tempest](https://tempestphp.com/blog/tempest-3)? Nevertheless, there's great news: we've just **tagged the new 3.0 release**, we're working on our roadmap for the coming months, and we've added another core contributor! Slowly but surely, Tempest feels like it's getting to a really great place, more and more people are using it, and more and more people are contributing. If you've been here for a while you know how proud I am of where the project has gotten, and that feeling is only growing stronger.

After getting so many positive responses about my performance optimization quest, I wanted to do something special with the community. That's why I've been working on organizing a kind of **performance optimization challenge**. It's still a work in progress, but the idea is that you'll have to solve a challenge in the fastest way possible with PHP. The winner gets a prize. Simple, right? Well, I hope it will be a fun challenge for the community to come together; I'll keep you posted about it!
