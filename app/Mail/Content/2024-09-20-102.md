pretext: "We've released the first alpha version of Tempest"

Hi ::subscriber.first_name::

Monday was a pretty big day: I released the first alpha version of Tempest into the wild. I didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised by all the positive feedback â€” I didn't expect it to go _that_ well. The thread on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1fi2dny/introducing_tempest_the_framework_that_gets_out/) did _really_ well, and the [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKwXyEbnyoI) was super nice; around 50 new people joined the [Tempest Discord](https://discord.gg/pPhpTGUMPQ), and some new people made their first contribution to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework).

Yeah, it was a good day, but now it's time to gather some real feedback. I want to pitch the **perfect weekend project** for you: play around with Tempest. It won't take much time to set up, and I hope you'll be as pleasantly surprised by it as many others. [The docs are here to get you started](https://tempestphp.com/docs/framework/01-getting-started).

Next on our roadmap are a lot of small things, but also some pretty big features. In my mind, there are still three important features missing before we can tag 1.0:

- A simple way to handle async tasks in the background
- Mail support
- Authentication support

And, of course, we're waiting for PHP 8.4 before 1.0 anyway.

Well, I hope you give it a try over the weekend, and let me know your thoughts, you can always contact me on Discord, open on issue on GitHub, or simply hit reply to this email.

Have a nice weekend!
