Today I've built something pretty cool, if I can say so myself. I wrote some code that takes a markdown file, and generates a video from it. Audio, video, it's all generated and stitched together programmatically. Why? It seemed like a nice exercise in learning some new tools, but I was also interested in learning about the current state of AI, and how it can help with generating video content. 

Now, don't worry! I will keep making my videos, newsletter and blog posts by hand! However, I do think it'll be interesting to see how AI will define the future for content creation, and so this was a very interesting experiment.

I made [a 10-minute video](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/d55a7cbf-26fa-45d5-87da-2d5ba9d9c0e2) showing the process and sharing some conclusions, I hope you'll give it a watch:

In other video news, I published another blog post of mine as a video as well. This time I'm talking about objective reasons why light colour schemes are better. I'm sure you'll agree, no? 

I do wonder what you think about these short-style videos? You can always let me know by hitting the reply button in this email. [You can watch it here](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/3e9cd26a-2404-403b-a1c8-e22206d3adec):

Finally, let's share some interesting posts I came across this week.

## Roundup

- **[Screenshots](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/4017fc93-bf44-432e-9097-48aae76fde22)** — Sebastian shares a very interesting way of keeping a digital journey. I'm tempted to try it myself. 
- **[CSS Nesting](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/825b6600-f3aa-447c-8783-19f9ab01966c)** — So apparently native CSS nesting is a thing now?!? It still needs proper browser support, but let me say I find this so amazingly awesome. I used SASS on my blog for two reasons: variables and nesting. So I'm very happy I'll be able to finally switch to native CSS soon-ish!
- **[Hakana: Taking Hack Seriously](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/7e0714fc-df4a-42da-b98d-d81f70606cad)** — An interesting post by the Slack team about how they've written a static analyser for Hack.
- **[The Dark Side of Dark Mode](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/d488d509-c012-4756-bc52-22275c170ffe)** — An interesting article that looks at the research that went into the "dark vs light mode" debate.   
- **[Request-Level Validation](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/747fdab5-e92a-4f23-858c-e179dab79d93)** — Andrew shares some thoughts about request validation in Laravel.

That's all for this week, until next time!
