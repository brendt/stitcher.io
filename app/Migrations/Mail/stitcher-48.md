It's been a while, hasn't it? I've got some pretty exciting news though! I've just released two new videos, the start of a mini series [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8hQ1fWU_mQ&list=PL0bgkxUS9EaKyOugEDffRzsvupBE2YEoD&ab_channel=BrentRoose).

In this series, we'll look at generics in PHP, why they aren't "a thing" yet, and what's possible in the future!

If you're not the video-type-of-person, you'll be happy to hear that you can also listen to this series in my Rant with Brent podcast ([Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/be/podcast/08-generics-in-php-the-basics/id1462956030?i=1000552913973), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0SdJtyTF73Us9Y2C4kR87g)), or you can just wait a couple of weeks, I'll post the transcripts on my blog as well.

_Do_ give it a chance on YouTube though: I'm trying hard to add some quality, PHP-related content over there, because I think it's lacking right now. I'd appreciate your support!

That's it for now, I'll keep you posted when the whole series has been published and when the textual versions are available.

Until next time!

Brent
