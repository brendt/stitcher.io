Hi! 

I've got a new update for you about some things I worked on the past weeks.

## Videos!

I made a new video! This is a short one about how PHP is very much alive in 2021. Take a look, leave a like, subscribe, and let me know what you think of it!

I also had the pleasure of hosting JetBrains' 8.1 video, together with some of the core developers and prominent community members. I'm very happy with the result, check it out: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgrQSmUiFJQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgrQSmUiFJQ).

## On the blog

PHP 8.1 was released a week or two ago, so naturally I did some final writing on that topic. I'm already looking out for PHP 8.2, I'll probably start writing about it at the start of next year!

- I benchmarked one of my real-life projects on PHP 8.1: [https://stitcher.io/blog/php-81-performance-in-real-life](https://stitcher.io/blog/php-81-performance-in-real-life)
- I wrote down some notes on updating to PHP 8.1 for those of us using Homebrew on Mac: [https://stitcher.io/blog/php-81-upgrade-mac](https://stitcher.io/blog/php-81-upgrade-mac)
- I made some final updates to my long-lasting "what's new in PHP 8.1" post: [https://stitcher.io/blog/new-in-php-81](https://stitcher.io/blog/new-in-php-81)

I don't think December will bring much more content, besides working on my [Dutch podcast](https://stitcher.io/de-job), I've been busy dealing with COVID and family. So This is probably my last update for 2021. I already wish you a blessed new year, and will talk to you soon.

Until then!

Brent
