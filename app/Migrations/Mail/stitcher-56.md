Hi there! 

Today I want to experiment with a slightly different approach to this newsletter. I don't want to focus on _my_ content alone but also share interesting stuff others have writing and tweeting about. I don't know if this is something I want to continue or not yet, so let me know your thoughts by hitting that reply button!
