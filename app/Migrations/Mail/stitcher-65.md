Hi there!

Every year, I write a post about the current overall state of PHP. I can't cover everything, but I try my best to paint an accurate image of the current PHP ecosystem. I'm happy to say that that post was just published, and you can read it right now: **[PHP in 2023](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/links/83abb4db-4dbd-468b-a9f5-b6e0b42f698b)**.

## Roundup

I wanted to share a couple of interesting posts I came across this past month, enjoy!
