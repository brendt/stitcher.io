Hi ::subscriber.first_name::

I don't like to be clever — have I said that before? The thing with clever solutions is that they might seem good in that moment, but rarely age well. One example is time intervals, and how we deal with them in programming languages. The sad part? Cleverness can often be avoided.

I made **a video about the "cleverness of date intervals"**, because I think it's an interesting topic to talk about. Give it a look, and let me know your thoughts in the comments: **[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7Qd_cPc_IQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7Qd_cPc_IQ)**.

Next, I wanted to mention that I'll be attending **SymfonyCon** on Thursday and Friday. I'll be giving an unconf talk together with my colleagues Roman and Artemy, and I'm looking forward to meeting PHP Developers all around. So, if you're going to SymfonyCon as well, definitely come say hi! 

Also, I'd like to thank all of you who joined the waiting list for **[my upcoming book](https://beyond-crud.com/)**. I mention it here once more, because not everyone reads all newsletters; and to say that the name of the book will soon change, to avoid confusion with _Laravel Beyond CRUD_. I've been talking about it in-depth to everyone on the waiting list, so if you want to join, you can **[visit the website](https://beyond-crud.com/)** and leave your email address.

Finally, a quick reminder about something big happening today at 5 PM CET: **[the JetBrains AI launch event](https://jb.gg/f4npqz)**. Definily come take a look, because there are lots of cool things to show!

That's all for this week's newsletter, thanks for tuning in!

Brent

PS: I've found time to work through my backlog of aggregate links, so I'll soon be able to share another roundup with you as well.
