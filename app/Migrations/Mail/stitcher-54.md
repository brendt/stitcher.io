Hi there!

Some exciting news today: Stitcher turned 5! In a way, that feels like a long time, although I was also thinking this week: "it feels longer than that". Anyway, it's a reason to celebrate! So first things first: **I'm giving away 5 Stitcher-themed elephpants**, keep on reading if you want one!

Looking back on five years, I want to share a couple of highlights that I'm most proud of with you, but I'd also like to hear from you: why are you here? What kind of content do you like the most? So don't hesitate to reply after you're done reading. (You'll have to reply anyway if you want one of those elephpantsâ€¦)

So, my personal highlights:

- [A programmer's cognitive load](https://stitcher.io/blog/a-programmers-cognitive-load): this was my first blogpost that really took off, and marked the real start of my blogging journey.
- My [New in PHP](https://stitcher.io/blog/new-in-php-82) series: it's still going, and I'm proud of how I've kept true to my own format these past years.
- My [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/BrenDtRoose), although still small, I really enjoy creating videos. I hope it'll grow as large as my blog and newsletter one day.
- Of course important to mention: this newsletter! We're at 17k active subscribers right now, and I really appreciate how many of you actually reply to my emails. I try to reply to all of them, but unfortunately that doesn't always work out. Know, however, that I really appreciate your replies, they mean a lot to me!
- Finally, all my writing about PHP's type system. I think [this post](https://stitcher.io/blog/we-dont-need-runtime-type-checks) summarizes my thoughts well. I think the community is slowly evolving towards a more static mindset, and I like to think that I'm helping with that evolution just a tiny bit, alongside many others. Still lots of work to be done though.

There are of course more highlights, but these are the ones that stood out to me today. So what about you? What kind of content are you following me for? Hit reply to let me know, and I'll pick 2 random replies that will get a Stitcher-themed elephpant! I'll give away the other three on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brendt_gd) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/BrenDtRoose), and you're absolutely free to try and get one on all three platforms. Subscribe and follow, and I'll let you know what to do in a couple of days.

Thanks for reading, and thank you for being here! 

Until next time

Brent
