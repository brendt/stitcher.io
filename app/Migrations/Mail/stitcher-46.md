Hi!

Happy new year! I hope you enjoyed your Christmas break — I sure did! It's January, and so it's time for a new, biyearly summary of PHP's version stats.

If you prefer to read the full post, head over to [https://stitcher.io/blog/php-version-stats-january-2022](https://stitcher.io/blog/php-version-stats-january-2022), but if you're short on time, here are the most important takeaways.

Here's the raw data:

<table class="table">

<tr class="table-head">
    <td>Version</td>
    <td>July, 2021 (%)</td>
    <td>January, 2022 (%)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>8.1</td>
    <td>0.1</td>
    <td>9.1</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>8.0</td>
    <td>14.7</td>
    <td>23.9</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>7.4</td>
    <td>46.8</td>
    <td>43.9</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>7.3</td>
    <td>19.2</td>
    <td>12.0</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>7.2</td>
    <td>10.4</td>
    <td>6.6</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>7.1</td>
    <td>3.8</td>
    <td>2.4</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>7.0</td>
    <td>1.3</td>
    <td>0.8</td>
</tr>

</table>

And here's the all-time usage evolution chart (you can click it to open a large version):

My key takeaway is that two out of three installs are using a version that isn't actively supported anymore (anything lower than 8.0). These numbers show there's still lots of work to do in educating people about modern PHP. If you want to help, you can show people the [blog post](https://stitcher.io/blog/php-version-stats-january-2022), or you can show them my recent video about modern PHP, I hope it gets at least some people excited about our beautiful language.
