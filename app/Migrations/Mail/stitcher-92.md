Hi ::subscriber.first_name::

First of all, it's that time of the year again: I've started writing my [What's new in PHP 8.4](https://stitcher.io/blog/new-in-php-84) blog post. If you're a long time subscriber, you know that I'll keep updating this post until PHP 8.4 is actually here, so make sure to bookmark it somewhere. I also published a new blog post about [Tagged Singletons](https://stitcher.io/blog/tagged-singletons) last week, I'm curious to hear your thoughts about it!

In other news, this week is celebration week, as PHP has just turned 29! ðŸŽ‰ Tomorrow, I'll be live with a couple of PHP developers to talk about PHP's past and future. I hope a lot of people will tune in to participate in chat, so check out the [scheduled stream here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQmGkpWYvHM). Oh, not unimportant to mention: we'll be giving away three limited edition PhpStorm Elephpants, so I think it would be a good idea to join ðŸ˜‰

Finally, some Tempest news: we've decided to move everything into one monorepo, and automatically split that one repo into separate readonly component packages. It's a bit complicated, but Aidan's handling most of the work. It means that I haven't worked a lot on Tempest for the past week, because I don't want to deal with merging things between repositories once the monorepo setup is complete. 

I do have some plans stewing thoughâ€¦ I'm considering to build a proper template engine for Tempest. Mainly because it sounds like a cool idea, and also because I brainstormed an approach that's pretty unique compared to existing templating engines. I'm not sure yet whether it's a _good_ idea, but it sure sounds like a fun one ðŸ˜…

All of that being said, I hope to [see you tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQmGkpWYvHM)!
