Hi there!

I've got a quick update for you about some things I worked on the past weeks.

## PHP 8.1

Just now, I've published a new blog post about being able to use "new" in initializers in PHP 8.1. You can read it here: [https://stitcher.io/blog/php-81-new-in-inititalizers](https://stitcher.io/blog/php-81-new-in-inititalizers). This is such a small feature, though one I believe will have a noticeable impact on many people's developer lives. I like it! 

If you want a quick summary about what's new in PHP 8.1, by the way, you can still subscribe to my [Road to PHP 8.1](https://road-to-php.com/) mini series! I'm also working on an updated version of [Front Line PHP](https://front-line-php.com/) for PHP 8.1, which will be a free upgrade for everyone who bought the book. 

Finally, if you can't wait to get your feet wet with PHP 8.1, it's good to know that [PHP 8.1 RC 3](https://externals.io/message/116185) is already available. PHP core developers do like it when people play around with these release candidates, in order to help find bugs. The [EAP build of PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/nextversion/) also supports most PHP 8.1 features, so it's the perfect time to start playing with it!

## The Road to PHP: Static Analysis

And just a quick update on the second edition of the Road to PHP: the series has started! If you weren't subscribed yet, and if you want to get started or learn some more things about static analysis, you can [now subscribe](https://road-to-php.com/static)! I've already received lots of positive feedback, which I really appreciate! 


That's it for this update, until next time!

Brent
