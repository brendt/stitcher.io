Hi ::subscriber.first_name::

Today is a big day! I'm tagging Tempest 1.0. If you're a long-time subscriber, you know how much time and effort has gone into this project, and I'm so excited about the next steps. But first, tagging! And what better way to do that than with a livestream? Depending on when you read this email, you can still catch me live, here's the link: [https://www.youtube.com/live/GqvGJpmUqn4](https://www.youtube.com/live/GqvGJpmUqn4).

If the livestream has already ended though, don't worry, because that means [Tempest is now stable](https://tempestphp.com/)!

In other news, PHPverse wrapped up last week, and all speaker videos are now published as well. It was an amazing event with over 15k people joining during the stream, which I'm so proud of. You can check out all the videos here: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0bgkxUS9EaI6rjDdRvihJn90OztDsxTO](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0bgkxUS9EaI6rjDdRvihJn90OztDsxTO).

I'm looking forward to the next edition!

Until next time

Brent
