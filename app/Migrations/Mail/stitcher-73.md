Ok, so, I had lots of fun working on this project: I built a little game in PHP with Livewire, and I didn't to write a single line of JavaScript for it to work. My goal was to explore LiveWire, so building a game seemed like a nice project.

I'm definitely not done yet. I know I've only scratched the surface of what LiveWire can do, so there'll be at least one more followup video. I also want to further explore the limitations of this approach — of course there are limitations as well.

In fact, let me give you a sneak-peek of one of my upcoming LiveWire experiments: a procedurally generated map to interact with. This is actually one of the examples where I'm running into the limitations of LiveWire, and where it'll be interesting to explore how to deal with them:

All of that coming soon(ish)!

Speaking of limitations, I also wanted to share a blog post I wrote last month. It's titled "[Limited by committee](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/40a6de1d-8390-4914-b539-b169acb519d6)". In it, I share some ideas about how PHP is designed, and how I think it has some major flaws. 

I really want to talk about this topic with more people — also people who don't agree with my opinion. Will you let me know your thoughts?

That's all I've got for today, except maybe one personal update: our baby girl is doing great, and I'm back to my normal working schedule after two months of taking it slow. So you can expect more regular newsletters again :) 

See you in the next one!
