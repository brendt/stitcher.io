Hi there! It's time for another roundup: in this email I'll share interesting links I came across, and tell you a little bit of my own thoughts on them. Let's dive in!

- **[The silent majority](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/5d94afde-d435-4e81-9265-8c36a2c4f109)** — Vadim confronts us with the silent majority of the tech industry: people who aren't vocal on social media, who aren't micro-influencers; people who simply code and do their job. We might not realise it, but the vocal people (that includes me writing this newsletter) are only a minority of programmers out there. We should be careful and aware of the silent majority vs. the vocal minority, and not have one group completely dictating our thoughts and opinions.
- **[Granular interfaces](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/a1835355-2d9c-41bb-99c2-81b172a8f18a)** — Looks like Seb is blogging again! This time he shows a practical example of how he refactored interfaces that grew larger over time. What's most important to me is that you don't need to get it right from the first time: "That doesn’t mean we should be paralyzed to find the perfect abstraction before we start".
- **[PHP in 1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppBhz7KMjWc)** — I made a video where I explain the essence of PHP in just one minute. Do you like it?
- **[Autocompletion in Artisan commands](https://twitter.com/cosmeescobedo/status/1562261829618786305)** — Just a "today I learned" moment for me: you can add autocompletion support in Laravel's artisan commands. Is there something Laravel cannot do??
- **[Some arguments against facades](https://twitter.com/_Codito_/status/1562325306119176192)** — To answer that previous question: maybe Laravel tries to do a bit _too much_ at times. Here's a twitter thread about why you probably shouldn't use facades. I wholly agree.
- **[Take care of your blog](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/166a885e-9c30-4c20-94ed-3f11bbd39874)** — A motivational post for bloggers — or people who want to start blogging. While blogging isn't for everyone, you might want to give it a shot.
- **[Asymmetric visions](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/bb93adad-d0b2-4a00-a5d9-d9c6590d25e9)** — I wrote down some thoughts about how PHP is currently developed.
- **[The “It's Just Like...” Heuristic](https://verraes.net/2021/05/its-just-like-heuristic/)** — Mathias shares some interesting thoughts: "When there’s a new idea, […] some very smart people will say that the new idea X is really just the old idea Y." — what does that imply?
- **[PhpStorm overview 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3em86DTafzE)** — My latest video for PhpStorm: a brief overview of why it's such a great tool. Do you use PhpStorm?
- **[Laracon Online Summer '22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4QShF42c6E)** — Laracon Online happened! You can watch all talks on YouTube; it's an amazing conference for all PHP developers, not only for the Laravel community!
- **[Laravel Bootcamp walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cPaw3QbOLA)** — On that previously mentioned Laracon, Taylor announced a bootcamp: a crash-course into Laravel for beginners. I sat down and walked through the Blade version, commentating while doing so.

That's all for today, I hope you enjoy these links as much as I did.

See you next time!
