Hi there!

Thank you for joining my newsletter. If you're reading this mail it means you've successfully subscribed and all is good :)

I can't make any promises on when my next newsletter will arrive. Maybe today, maybe next month â€” I don't have a fixed mailing schedule. If you want some more content though, you can check out [The Road to PHP 8.1](https://road-to-php.com/) and [The Road to PHP: Static Analysis](https://road-to-php.com/static); two 10-day email series that you might enjoy.

See you soon!

Brent
