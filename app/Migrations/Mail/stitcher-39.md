Hi there!

I'm really excited about today's mail, as I've got something new to share with you. You might have heard about this little newsletter series called "[The Road to PHP 8.1](https://road-to-php.com/)" before? Well, I'm working on a second edition: "**The Road to PHP: Static Analysis**"!

The idea is the same: subscribe to a 10-day newsletter series, teaching you about a specific topic (static analysis in this case), and you're automatically unsubscribed after 10 days. Well actually, I'm still working on the series, so if you'd subscribe today, you'll only be unsubscribed after the series has finished, but I think you get the point :)

But you heard it right: I've got an introduction to the series ready, and you can already [subscribe today](https://road-to-php.com/static). If you do, you'll receive a welcome mail with some more background information, and you'll receive all 10 mails starting somewhere in the coming weeks when I'm done. Don't worry by the way if you know nothing about static analysis, my goal is to teach about it from the ground up.

I hope you'll enjoy it! Now on to some other news!

## On my blog

Some people have told me they'd like to receive a new mail with every new blog post. The problem with that is that I sometimes write multiple blog posts in the span of just a few days, and I really don't want to send too many mails in short periods of time to you.

So instead I'll try to summarize all my new content whenever I send out a new mail, and remember that you can also subscribe to the [RSS feed](https://stitcher.io/feed) if you want realtime updates. 

So here's what I wrote the past weeks:

- [Named arguments and variadic functions](https://stitcher.io/blog/named-arguments-and-variadic-functions)
- [Some thoughts on PSRs](https://stitcher.io/blog/re-on-using-psr-abstractions)
- [About the beautiful design of my decade-old IKEA clock](https://stitcher.io/blog/my-ikea-clock)
- [Readonly Properties in-depth](https://stitcher.io/blog/php-81-readonly-properties)

## Mail updates

As you can see, I've reworked the style of these mail. Please let me know if anything looks off on your screen (a screenshot is appreciated). I hope you like a little more?

With all of that being said, I'm really looking forward to seeing you on this new [Road to PHP](https://road-to-php.com/static)! As always, don't hesitate to reply to this mail if you've got any questions or feedback!

Until next time!

Brent
