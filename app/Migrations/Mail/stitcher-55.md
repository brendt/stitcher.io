Hi there!

A new month with a new update, I've got plenty of things to share with you.

## PHP 8.2

PHP 8.2 has finally reached feature freeze, that means that we now know everything that will be added in this upcoming version. I've got something important to tell you about it as well: I've just opened up the brand new [Road to PHP 8.2](https://road-to-php.com/) series! 

You might be familiar with the previous editions but in case you're not, here's a quick summary. The Road to PHP is a newsletter series where you'll receive a daily email teaching you about a new feature of PHP. This time around we'll look at PHP 8.2 â€” in previous editions we looked at [PHP 8.1](https://road-to-php.com/php-81) and [static analysis](https://road-to-php.com/static).

Also don't forget that my [New in PHP 8.2](https://stitcher.io/blog/new-in-php-82) keeps getting updates, if you simply want a quick rundown, you can skim through that post.

## Vlogs

Once again I've been busy making videos! Two have already been published, and there's one more to be released soon (make sure to [subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/user/BrenDtRoose) if you want to get notified ðŸ˜‰). 

- **[The evolution of PHP: from PHP 5.6 to PHP 8.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9bSUo6TGgY)** â€” I'm especially proud of how this video turned out, and how well it was received!
- **[The problem with null](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0tstsbD4Ro)** â€” doing some digging into how to avoid using null, and improve your code.

## Blog

I've also published some more blog posts:

- **[Uncertainty, doubt, and static analysis](https://stitcher.io/blog/uncertainty-doubt-and-static-analysis)** â€” some extra thoughts that go with my video about null.
- **[The evolution of a PHP object throughout the years](https://stitcher.io/blog/evolution-of-a-php-object)** â€” I've updated this long running post with the PHP 8.2 version which brings readonly classes!
- **[PHP version stats: July, 2022](https://stitcher.io/blog/php-version-stats-july-2022)** â€” Twice a year I look at PHP's version stats to determine which versions are the most popular. 
- **[What's new in PHP 8.2](https://stitcher.io/blog/new-in-php-82)** â€” This is not a new post, but I once again updated it with several new features. To name a few: `true` as a standalone type, disjunctive normal form types, constants in traits, and more.

## PhpStorm

Finally, a quick word about PhpStorm: I've been working on content across the board for our upcoming release in the beginning of August. I'm especially excited about the video I've been working on, and I hope you'll like it too! I'll make sure to include it in the next edition of this newsletter. Something to look forward to!

That's about it for this edition, thank you for being here, enjoy your summer!
