Ok, so, I've started working on something â€” probably the biggest project I've worked on in a while â€” and I'm having a blast. I'm buildingâ€¦

A framework ðŸ˜³

Now, a little bit of context is in place, especially since I'm the one who said you should [never write your own framework](https://stitcher.io/blog/dont-write-your-own-framework).

I'm doing this for two reasons:

- First, it's an educational project, and I'm building it [live on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0bgkxUS9EaILnUL8Q4np6B3qxjQbE7PH). I've already done three livestreams, and plan on doing a bunch more.
- Second, I _do_ have some personal projects where I want to use it, but I don't foresee anyone using it in real-life projects.

So, if you want to follow along with me building Tempest (that's its name), you can check out the playlist. You're of course also welcome to join the stream, I plan on doing two or three a week. The best way to get notified is by [subscribing on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@phpannotated).

Finally, I will open-source the code, once it's a little further developed. I guess in a week or so.

I think it's a super cool and educational project, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. So don't hesitate to hit reply, and let me know!

Until next time
