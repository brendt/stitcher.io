Hi there

I'm happy to write another newsletter today, I've got some exciting things to share with you!

## New in PHP 8.2

Ah yes, it's that time of the year again: my "New in PHP" series is getting extended with another edition! PHP 8.2 will probably be released somewhere at the end of 2022, and so I've started collecting everything that's new in one blogpost. I'll of course make regular updates to this post, like I've done during the past years with other PHP releases.

It seems that PHP 8.2 had a slightly slower start than 8.0 and 8.1 — I assume that's mainly because of Nikita leaving PHP. However, the [Foundation](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/04/28/php-roundup-1/) has really kicked into gear now, so I'm looking forward to what's to come.

So, [what _is_ new in PHP 8.2?](https://stitcher.io/blog/new-in-php-82) The list will of course grow during the next months, but these are some of the features that stood out to me:

- Readonly classes
- Deprecated dynamic properties
- `null` and `false` as standalone types
- And [a couple more things](https://stitcher.io/blog/new-in-php-82).

You know what to do! Hit reply and tell me your favourite or most dreaded new feature!

## Start to blog

In other news — I'm feeling quite nervous telling you about this — I've written a book. Or, more accurately: I'm writing a book. It's not necessarily a technical book, although I do cover several technical aspects: it's a book about building and growing your blog, and your online presence in general. 

I've been writing on the web for 7 years now and I've constructed a kind of mental framework for myself over the years. While I don't make a living off my blog, it's a nice side project, and still a passion to this day.

And so I wrote about the lessons I've learned along the way and I hope it might inspire people to do the same. There's still some work to be done, I think I'm ~75% done, but you can already buy the work in progress book (and of course get the final version for free) on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/start-to-blog). I don't really want to give a marketing speech though; you're a newsletter subscriber, you know me, I'm sure you'll check it out if you're interested.

And, of course: all kind of feedback is much appreciated!

## Aggregate

Have you heard that I've revived [aggregate](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/)? I mentioned it in my previous newsletter as well. I'm happy to report that it's been live for a month, and I truly enjoy working on it. There's already a small niche audience, so I just wanted to mention it once more, in case you're interested in following a manually-curated, public RSS feed on the web.

## Laracon

Finally, I went to Laracon EU! It was fun, and of course I made a vlog about it as well. I was especially excited about the intro I made, so I'd love to hear your feedback: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnkWExEUJYM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnkWExEUJYM).

With all of that being said, thanks for reading, and until next time!
