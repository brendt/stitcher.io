"Both managers were looking at me in disbelief, they seemed to be stunned for a few seconds. I just told them I had decided to quit."

Ten years ago, I worked at a company where, slowly but surely, I felt more and more stuck. I already wrote about it a long time ago, but I feel like the message is important enough to share once more.

Perhaps you recognise that feeling of being stuck, not seeing a way out of that vicious circle, in a job that doesn't make you happy? In that case, you can to [watch my story here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Q1BmNSujk):

In the end, I don't regret having worked for that particular company: I did learn valuable lessons. It's ok to be at a place where there's little or no room for growth, as long as it's not too long. I learned that you've got to watch out, and critically assess your situation from time to time.

My advice? Either try to change your position and responsibilities within the company or, if that doesn't work, change jobs. I realise that's easy to write, and I also realise it's not as easy as it sounds. Personally, I noticed being stuck after two years, and it took me another whole year to find a place where I believed there was enough room to grow. I'm happy I found that new place. 

## On a personal note

I'm very happy being able to consistently send this newsletter for quite a while now, and I hope you are too. _However_, I've got some things coming up very soon that'll probably prevent me from writing a newsletter for a while: our baby girl is almost ready to be born! 

If you have kids then you know about the many _unknowns_ of a pregnancy, a birth, and a baby; so I just wanted to mention it already, now that I'm still able to write this newsletter. I might be quiet for a couple of weeks, it's all fine :)

## Roundup

I hope you're still enjoying these roundups? By the way: don't hesitate to mail me interesting content as well (it can be your own), I'm happy to take a look and might include it here!

- **[PHP wishlist: The pipe operator](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/28ccc615-7a53-4763-87e3-98de008deaa9)** — Seb writes about a potential "pipe operator", it's definitely on my wish list too!
- **[Laravel Pennant](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/289a9cb3-29c6-4ba0-a4f6-d551815b421e)** — A new package from the Laravel core team to manage feature flags. It's a bit of a strange name (I definitely had to look up the meaning), but it seems like a very nice package!
- **[Managing Routes in a large Laravel application](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/88f35a57-fee0-4ea6-8439-d7b6770842c6)** — It's Steve once again! This time he's writing about ways of dealing with large route files. 
- **[The Front-End Developer's Guide to the Terminal](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/8c6dec8b-52f2-43d4-977a-6a26f99bd001)** — Another great post by Josh Comeau: "Our whole job is to build graphical user interfaces, but the tools we use in our development are mostly command-line based!" 
- **[What happens if your development team is hit by a bus?](https://aggregate.stitcher.io/post/f1ce10b6-1b2a-4e19-9d89-1df0e2e08efd)** — Yeah, what happens?

That's all for this week! I hope to write to you soon, we'll see :)

Until next time!
