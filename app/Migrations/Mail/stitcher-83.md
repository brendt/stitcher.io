Hello ::subscriber.first_name::

I'm excited. 

For many things, but right now, mostly for two. The first one is PHP 8.3, which will be released **tomorrow**. It's nice to see the hard work of so many people getting released into the world. It's also a good reminder that we're nearing the end of 2023 already üò≥. To celebrate, I will host a livestream together with [Freek](https://twitter.com/freekmurze) and [Roman](https://twitter.com/pronskiy). We'll talk about PHP's history, reflect on its future, the PHP Foundation, and we'll make a tier list of recent-ish PHP features.

What's most important: we want to connect with you, the PHP community. So don't hesitate to come say hi tomorrow in chat: we'll be live starting at 13:00, CET: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWryF035B6U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWryF035B6U).

The second thing‚Ä¶ well. That's actually still a secret for now ü§ê. **But**: you ‚Äî subscribers of this mailing list ‚Äî will be the first to hear about it in a couple of weeks. I think it's one of the biggest things I worked on in a couple of years, so yes, I'm rather excited about it!

I also wanted to mention to everyone who's using PhpStorm: we added support for PHP 8.3 in the latest 2023.2.4 update. That means that you might want to check for updates if you want to try out PHP 8.3 tomorrow.

That's all I have for today, but many exciting things are coming soon! I hope to see you in chat tomorrow to celebrate PHP 8.3 together! 

Until next time

Brent
