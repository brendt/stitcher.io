I'm very happy to announce that my Road to PHP series is back! This time you can join [The Road to PHP 8.2](https://road-to-php.com/)!

If you're unfamiliar with the concept: the Road to PHP is a newsletter series where you'll receive a daily email teaching you about a new feature of PHP. This time around we'll look at [PHP 8.2](/blog/new-in-php-82) â€” in previous editions we looked at [PHP 8.1](https://road-to-php.com/php-81) and [static analysis](https://road-to-php.com/static).

In total, almost 7000 people have followed one of my Road to PHP series, and many have told me they like the format where they can start their day with a 5-minute read, straight to their inbox.

By the way: you won't receive any followup every afterwards: you're automatically unsubscribed, unless you specifically decide to subscribe to [my main newsletter](https://stitcher.io/mail) afterwards.

I'd say: give it a try, and [join the Road to PHP 8.2](https://road-to-php.com/)!
