How do we read code? Are there things we can do to make that reading more easy?
I recently gave a talk about this exact topic.

In this talk, I gave six pointers to improve this visual perception,
to make it easier to read your own code: fonts, code folding, colours, patterns, documentation and names.

These are the links mentioned in the video:

- [A programmer's cognitive load](/blog/a-programmers-cognitive-load)
- [Mastering key bindings](/blog/mastering-key-bindings)
- [Where a curly bracket belongs](/blog/where-a-curly-bracket-belongs)

The colour scheme used is a port of Mozilla's Photon Light theme. 
Here's the [PHPStorm version](*https://github.com/brendt/photon-light).

I you have any thoughts coming to mind, if you want to discuss this further 
or tell me I'm wrong; 
you can reach me on [Twitter](*https://twitter.com/brendt_gd) or via [e-mail](mailto:brendt@stitcher.io).
