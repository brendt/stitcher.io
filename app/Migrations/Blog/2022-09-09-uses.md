- For cam recording — I always have a script written word by word
- [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) for code and blog content
- [Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html) for video editing
- [Audition](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html) for audio editing
