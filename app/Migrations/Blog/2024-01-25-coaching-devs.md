> I started my PHP journey in 2016. That means PHP 7.0 is what I started with. I decided to return to my first job after a year and a half of working with Java and TypeScript. I'm a big fan of OOP and a strong type system. I know we can use that in PHP as well, and that was the reason why I came back to PHP. I asked myself, "Why should I do web in a different language?!" and I had no answer to me.

> Currently, I am a team lead of a small team working with Laravel. One of my tasks is to review pull requests in GitHub, and guide the team. During one of my code reviews, I noticed that one of the developers is still using PHP like the old days â€” "version 5 old": no types, old code style, etc.

> I talked to them about this being an issue multiple times, but just now, I am facing another PR with no types at all. That pisses me off because that same person also worked on a frontend feature where they went over the top to create a wonderful page.

> I'm pissed off, because if you have hours and hours to do that, you should have time to add types in your PHP code as well.

> So Brent, I want to ask you for advice. Have you had to deal with a dev like that? What was your approach? I understand they are more interested in design and frontend, but on the other hand, I do not want to compromise on code quality.
