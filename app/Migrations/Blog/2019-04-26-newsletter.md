I'm going to give it a try: newsletters. 
I'm always on the lookout for connecting more with my audience, 
and feel like newsletters are a more personalised way of communication: 
people can hit reply to engage in a one-on-one conversation.
For me, email is the perfect platform to do that.

## The concept

What to expect if you subscribe?
First of all I'll try to send out one newsletter every month, more or less.
I won't spam you every day or week.
This also gives me ample time to write, review and rewrite the mail. 
That's the same way I write my blog posts, and works very well for me.

My goal is to write a mini-blog post for every mail, 
about a topic I've encountered the past month. 
Next I'll also give some useful php-related tips and tricks. 
Finally I'll share one or two, maybe three; links to interesting reads on the web.

That's what I envision the newsletter to look like, at least for now.

So, if you're interested, here's the signup link: [https://stitcher.io/signup](https://stitcher.io/signup). 
The first edition will be sent sometime in the next two weeks.
