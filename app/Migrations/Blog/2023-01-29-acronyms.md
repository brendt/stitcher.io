I'm suspicious of acronyms. Think about it: is it a coincidence that the five most important principles in programming just _happen_ to line up to form the word "SOLID"?

I'm suspicious of acronyms because there's always _someone_, _somewhere_, making compromises to make them work. Whether it is by omitting equally (or more) important elements because they don't fit the acronym; whether less important elements are _included_ to make it work; or whether names are changed, their meaning obfuscated, so that they'd fit perfectly.

Acronyms are of course a great choice to market your ideas because, well, people tend to remember them. SOLID is the perfect example.
