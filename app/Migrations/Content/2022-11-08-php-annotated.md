Some very exciting news today! If you're a regular reader of this blog, you know that I've been working on my [YouTube channel](https://stitcher.io/yt) for the past years as a hobby project. You might also know that I've been a [developer advocate at JetBrains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsURiWAd6eI) for half a year now.

Today, these two blend together! My personal channel will now be known as "PHP Annotated", and I'll be able to work on it as part of my job!

I'm really excited about this, especially since the goal of the channel will stay exactly the same: creating quality content, focussed on the PHP community. So don't worry: the channel won't become a "marketing channel", it'll still be me, doing the same things I was already doing — but now more and better!

If you're curious what I've been doing, you can watch my brand new "What's new in PHP 8.2" video right now!

I hope you're excited, and would love for you to spread the word! Also make sure to subscribe if you want to be kept in the loop. If you've got any questions, you can reach me — as always — via [Twitter](*https://twitter.com/brendt_gd) or [e-mail](mailto:brendt@stitcher.io).
