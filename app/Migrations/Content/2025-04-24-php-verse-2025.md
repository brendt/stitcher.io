I have amazing news: together with some colleagues at JetBrains, we've been working hard these past months preparing an awesome event, and it's finally time to talk about it.

**On June 17th, we'll host a free and online event for the whole community to celebrate PHP's 30th birthday: PHPverse 2025!**

There will be talks and Q&A sessions with Nicolas Grekas, Taylor Otwell, Kevin Dunglas, the PHP Foundation, and more; we'll give away awesome — dare I say _very exclusive_ — gifts; and we'll have a great time celebrating the language we all love.

The only thing you need to do is let us know you'll come, you can do that via [this registration page](https://jb.gg/eg0hny).

I hope to see you there!
