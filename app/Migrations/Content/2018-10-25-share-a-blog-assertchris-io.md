[Christopher Pitt](*https://twitter.com/assertchris) is one of the inspirations why I got into blogging and conference talks.
Being an excellent writer&thinsp;—&thinsp;he used to blog on Sitepoint and Medium&thinsp;—&thinsp;he now decided to host his content on his own website.
A wise decision!

I'd highly recommend adding his blog to your RSS reader, or bookmark it somewhere: [assertchris.io](*https://assertchris.io/).
There's lots of good content to look forward to!
