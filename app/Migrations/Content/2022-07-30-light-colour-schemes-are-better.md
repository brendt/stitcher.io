I just released a video about light colour schemes. I've been encouraging people to try them out for a while now, with pretty good results, actually. I've challenged people to try it out for a week, it certainly doesn't work for everyone, but I've gotten lots of positive reactions on it as well. People actually got rid of persisting headaches because of it, they found their code to be more readable, etc.

Simply switching to a light colour scheme isn't enough though, you need to take some extra steps. And that's exactly the point of this video, to explain what those steps are. I hope you give it a look, and let me know in [the comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu0HJ0_kprc&ab_channel=BrentRoose) whether you're taking up the one-week light theme challenge!
