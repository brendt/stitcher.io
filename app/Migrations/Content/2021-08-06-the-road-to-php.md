I'm happy to announce a fun little project today: [The Road to PHP 8.1](https://road-to-php.com/). It's a 10-day popup newsletter that'll teach you about all the shiny new things in PHP 8.1. The only thing you'll need to do is drop your name and email address, and you'll receive a daily email for the next 10 days.

Worried about spam or followup mails? You'll be automatically unsubscribed after those 10 days, I'm not keeping your email address! 

You can [subscribe here](https://road-to-php.com/), and see whether it's your thing or not.
