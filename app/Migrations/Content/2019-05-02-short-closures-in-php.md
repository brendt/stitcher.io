Short closures, also called arrow functions, are a way of writing shorter functions in PHP. 
This notation is useful when passing closures to functions like `array_map` or `array_filter`.

{{ ad:carbon }}

This is what they look like:

```php
// A collection of Post objects
$posts = [/* â€¦ */];

$ids = <hljs prop>array_map</hljs>(<hljs keyword>fn</hljs>($post) => $post-><hljs prop>id</hljs>, $posts);
``` 

Previously, you'd had to write this:

```php
$ids = <hljs prop>array_map</hljs>(function ($post) {
    return $post-><hljs prop>id</hljs>;
}, $posts);
```

Let's summarize how short closures can be used.

- They are available as of PHP 7.4
- They start with the `fn` keyword
- They can only have _one_ expression, which is the return statement
- No `return` keyword allowed
- Arguments and return types can be type hinted

A more strictly typed way of writing the example above could be this:

```php
$ids = <hljs prop>array_map</hljs>(<hljs keyword>fn</hljs>(<hljs type>Post</hljs> $post): <hljs type>int</hljs> => $post-><hljs prop>id</hljs>, $posts);
``` 

Two more things to mention:

- The spread operator is also allowed
- References are allowed, both for the arguments as the return values

If you want to return a value by reference, the following syntax should be used:

```php
<hljs keyword>fn</hljs>&($x) => $x
```

In short, short closures allow the same functionality you'd expect from normal closures, 
with the exception of only allowing one expression.

## No multi-line

You read it right: short closures can only have _one_ expression; that one expression may be spread over multiple lines for formatting, but it must always be one expression. 

The reasoning is as follows: the goal of short closures is to reduce verbosity. 
`fn` is of course shorter than `function` in all cases.
Nikita Popov, the creator of the RFC, however argued that if you're dealing with multi-line functions, 
there is less to be gained by using short closures.

After all, multi-line closures are by definition already more verbose;
so being able to skip two keywords (`function` and `return`) wouldn't make much of a difference.

Whether you agree with this sentiment is up to you. 
While I can think of many one-line closures in my projects, 
there are also plenty of multi-line ones, and I'll personally miss the short syntax in those cases.

There's hope though: it is possible to add multi-line short closures in the future, 
but that's an RFC on its own.

## Values from outer scope

Another significant difference between short and normal closures is that the short ones don't 
require the `use` keyword to be able to access data from the outer scope.

```php
$modifier = 5;

<hljs prop>array_map</hljs>(<hljs keyword>fn</hljs>($x) => $x * $modifier, $numbers);
```  

It's important to note that you're not allowed to modify variables from the outer scope.
Values are bound by value and not by reference. 
This means that you _could_ change `$modifier` within the short closure, 
though it wouldn't have effect on the `$modifier` variable in the outer scope.

One exception is of course the `$this` keyword, which acts exactly the same as normal closures:

```php
<hljs prop>array_map</hljs>(<hljs keyword>fn</hljs>($x) => $x * $this->modifier, $numbers);
```

## Future possibilities

I already mentioned multi-line short closures, which is still a future possibility.
Another idea floating around is allowing the short closure syntax in classes, for example for getters and setters:

```php
class Post {
    private $title;
 
    <hljs keyword>fn</hljs> <hljs prop>getTitle</hljs>() => $this->title;
}
```

All in all, short closures are a welcome feature, though there is still room for improvement. 
The biggest one probably being multi-line short closures.
